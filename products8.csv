Bridgford Sweet Baby Ray's Beef Jerky, Honey Chipotle	3 oz (85 g)	Gourmet sauces. Good source of protein. 0 g trans fat per serving. In 1985, my brother, Chef Larry Raymond perfected the family's recipe and entered our sweet and tangy barbecue sauce into the country's largest rib cookoff.

Within a year, Larry and I, along with our high school friend Mike O'Brien, formed a company around our award-winning sauce and our simple philosophy about barbecue. The sauce is the boss.

Heat and serve in minutes. US inspected and passed by Department of Agriculture. What is Big Shoulders Smokehouse BBQ? Big Shoulders Smokehouse is a unique combination of time honored regional styles, blended together to create the ultimate barbeque experience. Authentic barbeque is about more than just the sauce. It's about the meat and how you select it, season it, and slow smoke it to bring out the natural richness. Big Shoulders Smokehouse dramatically defines Chicago-Style barbeque by taking what you know about barbeque to a higher level. How do we do it? Attention to detail. We hand select only the highest quality baby back pork ribs, choosing meaty, tender ribs that provide great texture and flavor. Next we gently rub each rack with a unique blend of savory spices that bring out the natural flavor of our ribs. Then we slowly naturally smoke them for hours using select hickory wood. Finally, when the time is right, we slather each rack with our sweet and tangy sauce to create the perfect balance of flavor. Big Shoulders Smokehouse delivers the quality and taste that rivals your favorite restaurant, yet they're fast and easy to prepare at home. Your family will appreciate that our ribs are made with no artificial ingredients or preservatives, perhaps that is what makes them so delicious. Questions or Comments Call: (708) 771-3600.

Waterhill Naturals Coconut Water, 100% Pure Organic	16 fl oz (1 pt) 473 ml	Cold-extracted for superior taste. USDA organic. Contains 100% juice. A product from Farmer's Cooperative. The only USDA organic certified cooperative. Certified organic by Control Union. Visit us at waterhillnaturals.com. That deliciously hydrating taste doesn't happen by accident. It starts with young coconuts, grown in ideal conditions in the Ratchaburi region of Thailand. It's from farmers who know exactly when they're perfectly ripe for picking. And it comes from cold-extracting their water within four hours of leaving the tree and then keeping it cold. We do it this way on purpose. Because to us, doing things the right way is the only way. Clear or Pink - It's All Good: Naturally occurring antioxidants in coconut water sometimes turn pink when they interact with light. We embrace it. It's all natural either way. The Proof is in Every Sip: only 100% pure coconut water; not from concentrate; certified organic and non GMO; natural source of antioxidants; naturally hydrating electrolytes; vegan; no added anything.

Tropical Chips Chips, Plantain	3 oz (85 g)	Plantains. The alternative snack. 0 g trans fat. Tropical chips made from plantains. The Plantain: A delicious fruit from the Tropics similar to the banana but with a very distinctive taste. It can be eaten raw but the plantain, either green or ripe, is generally eaten cooked. When we make our pleasant-tasting crispy plantain chips, we start by carefully selecting the highest quality green plantains which are then peeled, sliced and cooked in 100% non-hydrogenated vegetable oil (zero trans fat).
