Bigelow Herbal Tea, Caffeine Free, Peppermint, Bags	20 bags [0.91 oz (25 g)]	Tea bags individually wrapped in foil pouches. Freshness stays in. Air and moisture stays out. America's classic. Family tea blenders since 1945. Refreshing peppermint - pure & simple. All natural. Because mama moved the pony stable. In 1945, Ruth Bigelow was trying to establish a market for her new product, Constant Comment Tea. This was no easy task. One evening, Ruth was sharing her discouragement when her sister said - Remember-Mama moved the pony stable. As a child, Ruth's family had a pony named Bottoms, who lived in a sturdy stable outside of the Bigelow's home. When her father announced one day that the family was moving to the other side of Providence, the children lamented that Bottoms would never be happy without his stable. Though she knew it would be a great deal of work, finally, Ruth's mother said, The stable will come. The move commenced and they all paraded across Providence. It took four rented horses and six hired workmen to move the stable while Bottoms trotted behind them. Well-wishers, advice-givers and hecklers followed. On the Bigelow's first night in a strange new house in Providence, Bottoms had his familiar stable. As Ruth relived these scenes, the significance of her sister's comment was clear: if she wanted to do something badly enough she could. Whenever Ruth was feeling defeated, she would remind herself, Mama moved the pony stable. This always gave her the courage and ingenuity to carry on. - The Bigelow family. Unlock the freshness.

Bigelow Black Tea, Classic, Plantation Mint, Bags	20 tea bags [1.18 oz (33 g)]	Fresh and flavorful tea blended with natural spearmint leaves. All natural. Blended with 100% American grown spearmint. Tea bags individually wrapped in foil pouches. Freshness stays in. Air and moisture stay out. America's classic. Family tea blenders since 1945. Whose idea was this anyway? I knew my mother-in-law (Ruth) was a peppermint fan. But I loved spearmint. Every time I would mention spearmint to Ruth she showed no interest. So I decided to take matters into my own hands. My husband David and I went behind closed doors and started experimenting. We wanted a smooth flavorful premium tea to partner with a subtle spearmint flavor. We tried tea after tea to find the perfect combination. Then we set out to find a spearmint grown in America. We tried several spearmints and fell in love with one from a farm out west. Once we created the perfect blend we had to figure out how to share with Ruth our new invention. To be honest, we were nervous. That is when David came up with the perfect plan. So, on Mother's Day that year we were celebrating with Ruth and gave her a gift. Yes the very first box of Plantation Mint!!! She gave us a funny look and then decided to try it - she loved it! All these years later we think back to that day and smile. We hope our tea delights you. - Eunice J Bigelow.

She would personally select and then wrap the perfect gift for each and every employee. Ruth would hand deliver the gifts and extend her gratitude to all for their hard work and dedication to her little tea company. This tradition would continue on as our company grew with my parents selecting different gifts for me and my sister Lori to hand out to each employee. Our mother would dress us in matching outfits that she had hand sewn. I was so excited to be a part of this ritual. With each delivery I insisted on hugging and kissing every employee! As the company continues to grow we have found new ways to honor this tradition. Gifts are still given out, but it is now the children and grandchildren of our employees that are the recipients at our annual North Pole Party. For three generations giving smiles and thanks to our employees and their families has become a Bigelow holiday tradition. We hope our tea delights you.

Bigelow Green Tea, with Peach, Bags	20 bags [0.91 oz (25 g)]	Tea bags individually wrapped in foil pouches. Freshness stays in. Air and moisture stays out. America's classic. Family tea blenders since 1945. A sweet peach note enhances our delicate green tea. Healthy antioxidants. All natural. The Connecticut Tea Party. In 1955, Bigelow Tea moved from New York to Connecticut. Soon afterwards, back-to-back hurricanes hit! Connecticut rivers, including the Norwalk River, where the new factory resides, rose up over 35 feet, moving over 50 miles an hour. Ruth and David Bigelow worried desperately about their fledging 10 year old business. When they finally reached the factory, they saw their own version of the Connecticut Tea Party. The building was flooded and all of their tea had washed down the river. Although devastated, Ruth (in her 60's) and David (in his late 70's), were determined not to give up their dream. Turning to an employee, Ruth asked How long till we can get back in business? It took tremendous effort to get everything in order again. However, with the help of their creditors who extended them whatever they needed, the Bigelows were back in business in just a few months. Their tenacity is the foundation of what our company is built on. Our family learned two lessons that we still adhere to: always pay your bills on time, and when you get knocked down, just get right back up! - The Bigelow family. Unlock the freshness. Here's the key - we use a special foil pouch to protect your tea from any air, moisture and surrounding aromas. So open and enjoy the unparalleled flavor, freshness, aroma of Bigelow Tea everywhere we go! Caff-o-Meter Content Per Serving: Green tea 25-50 mg.

When they finally reached the factory, they saw their own version of the Connecticut Tea Party. The building was flooded and all of their tea had washed down the river. Although devastated, Ruth (in her 60's) and David (in his late 70's), were determined not to give up their dream. Turning to an employee, Ruth asked How long till we can get back in business? It took tremendous effort to get everything in order again. However, with the help of their creditors who extended them whatever they needed, the Bigelows were back in business in just a few months. Their tenacity is the foundation of what our company is built on. Our family learned two lessons that we still adhere to: always pay your bills on time, and when you get knocked down, just get right back up! - The Bigelow family. Unlock the freshness.

Son don't tell your mother - Back in 1945, when the Bigelow Tea company first started, Ruth Bigelow and the family could only afford a single-color label for her tea. To help spruce up the package, David Jr. and David Sr. would sit together each night, hand-painting the two ladies on the original label. Each morning, they would put the tea into the family station wagon and sell it store by store. One night, David Sr. turned to David Jr. and said Son, don't tell your mother, but I don't think this company is ever going anywhere. Almost 70 years later, David Jr. still smiles at the memory, and is grateful that his father was mistaken. Today, Bigelow Tea is the specialty tea leader in the US.

In Delaware, sometime in the 1600's, early colonists created a very special tea made by blending grated orange peel and ground sweet spice. The mixture would be put into stone crocks and stored in cold cellars. Ruth was intrigued. She thought this might just be the kind of tea with which to launch a new tea company - a dream she'd had for many years. There was just one problem: this story had given her an idea, but no recorded recipe. Undaunted, Ruth disappeared into her kitchen and began sperimenting (a favorite word of hers). After weeks of trial and error, she emerged with her version of this early Colonial creation. And so Constant Comment, our company's very first tea, was born. - The Bigelow Family.

Sometime in 1942 or '43, my mom and dad decided they wanted to start a tea business. At the time, we lived in a small apartment in Manhattan. They felt strongly that, for the company to be a success, they needed a home where they could begin. Searching the local streets, they found a brownstone, just off of Second Avenue, which was in terrible disrepair. Optimistic, they bought it with the last of their life savings, and replastered and repainted it themselves. It was in this home in 1945, where my mom and dad opened the doors to the new Bigelow Tea Company.

Traditional Medicinals Herbal Tea, Organic, Chamomile, Naturally Caffeine Free, Bags	16 bags [0.74 oz (20.8 g)]	Herbal Supplement. Herbal teas. Wrapped tea bags. Fair Trade Certified. Non GMO Project verified. nongmoproject.org. USDA organic. Created by herbalists. Since 1974. Non-GMO project verified tea bag & string. Matricaria recutita. Personality: An all-around classic - lovely and gentle. Herbal Power: Calms your nervous system, soothes and supports your digestion. Reason to Love: One of the most widely used and well-loved herbs of the world, we adore chamomile for its mildly bittersweet, flowery taste and its ability to soothe and calm the body, mind and spirit. Our chamomile is a cut above the common chamomile you'll find in most teas. Made from only the white and yellow, tiny, daisy-like flowers (no stems and leaves here), we think of our chamomile tea as a cup of peaceful, easy feelings-plain and simple. Taste: Fragrantly floral, honey-like and bittersweet. It's not easy being blue - chamomile's soothing properties can be attributed, in part, to the essential oil, which, when extracted, is an amazing blue color. Concentrated in the flowering tops, we look for chamomile with high amounts of this blue oil, so every cup of our tea will surely soothe your system. Don't worry though - your tea won't turn blue. Some of our favorite chamomile comes from organic, Fair Trade Certified farms in Egypt's fertile Nile River Valley, where the farmers and the plants enjoy a better quality of life. www.traditionalmedicinals.com. We've Got the Right Stuff: We raise the bar. The quality standard of the herbs we use is hard to pronounce, difficult to meet, and it's what makes us different, better. We're not ashamed to say it. Pharmacopoeial: it's the only quality standard our herbalists can rely on when blending teas for your health and wellness. Certified by the California Certified Organic Farmers (CCOF).

Traditional Medicinals Herbal Tea, Organic, Ginger Aid, Naturally Caffeine Free, Bags	16 bags [1.13 oz (32 g)]	Herbal Supplement. Digestive teas. Promotes healthy digestion. Wrapped tea bags. New look. Same great tea! Non GMO Project verified. nongmoproject.org. USDA organic. Created by herbalists. Since 1974. Non-GMO project verified tea bag & string. Zingiber offincinale. Personality: Spicy and soothing. Herbal Power: Gets the digestive juices flowing, relieves occasional indigestion and prevents nausea associated with motion. Reason to Love: If you're a fan of spice, or just dig ginger's digestive soothing properties, you're going to love this robust herbal blend. With plenty of zesty ginger, combined with mellow blackberry leaf and lemon myrtle leaf, this tea is great to drink before meals to warm up your digestive system. It's also good after dinner to promote healthy digestion - especially if you've over indulged. Taste: Characteristically spicy ginger, slightly sweet and lemony. We source this ginger primarily from India, where it thrives in a humid, tropical climate. Ginger's rhizome - or underground, horizontal stem (commonly called a root) - sprouts the plant's first shoots within two weeks of planting. Our organic farming partners harvest the rhizomes after about nine months, when ginger's power is at its peak, then cut them and dry them for our teas. We love this spicy tea, blended with blackberry leaf and lemon myrtle for added zing. Not only does it support healthy digestion, but it's also a great addition to your everyday wellness routine. www.traditionalmedicinals.com. We've Got the Right Stuff: We raise the bar. The quality standard of the herbs we use is hard to pronounce, difficult to meet, and it's what makes us different, better. We're not ashamed to say it.

Non GMO Project verified. nongmoproject.org. Tabebuia impetiginosa. Personality: Gorgeous, strong and enigmatic. Herbal Power: Used historically by the indigenous peoples of South America and modern day herbalists. Reason to Love: We love this amazingly beautiful, flowering tree, also known as Pink Ipe or Pink Lapacho, due to its stunning pinkish, purple trumpet-like flower.

With a reputation for use dating back well before the time of the Incas (that was a good 700 years ago or so), Pau d'Arco is well-known and loved throughout South America. It is widely used as an ornamental tree and can be found lining the streets of many South American cities - it's even the national tree of Paraguay! It's also well-loved for its hard, durable wood and was used to make the hunting bows of the indigenous people who inhabited the rainforests of the Amazon.

Made with potent Chinese purification herbs. Traditional support of the defenses. Chinese herbs for healthy skin. Triple Leaf Tea's Ancient Chinese Medicinals: Traditional Chinese medicine began in approximately 2500 B.C. Recently, here in the West, people have discovered the value of this ancient system which focuses on aiding the body's own healing mechanisms through restoring harmony and balance. The Chinese system of herbology has been recorded in ancient texts which are studied and employed even today. This time tested knowledge has been passed on from generation to generation over the centuries. Triple Leaf Tea comes from such a tradition. It is made in the USA by a Chinese American family-owned business. The company owner can remember stories of his own grandfather selling herbs and teas in his village in China. Today, these traditional Chinese herbal formulas are available to you. We wish you harmony and balance! The Detox Chinese Herbal Tea Tradition: For thousands of years, the Chinese have been using herbs to clear away toxins. Today, we are exposed to increasing levels of harmful environmental pollutants and toxins in smoke, air, water and food. Many synergistic and potent Chinese purification herbs have been used to create our Detox Tea. Traditionally, these herbs were used to support the healthy function of the liver, kidneys, lungs and blood, and to cleanse the body of toxins. They were considered and help promote clear, healthy skin, increase the flow of energy (chi) to the body and mind, and promote calmer, more positive and peaceful emotions.

Yogi Green Tea, Pure Green, Bags, Organic	16 tea bags [1.09 oz (31 g)]	Herbal Supplement. USDA organic. Supports vitality. 100% natural. Contains caffeine. So Good It's Pure Green Tea: Thousands of years ago, Chinese physicians recommended Green Tea as a natural path to vitality and longevity. Today we know this delicious tea, with its natural antioxidant properties, enhances the body's defenses against damaging free radicals. We searched far and wide for the highest quality organic green tea leaves in India, China and Sri Lanka, then carefully combined these delightful teas to create a flavorful and complex blend with a subtle yet elegant aroma. Embark on a journey to vitality with a cup of our Pure Green tea. Yogi Principles: Tasting great is essential, but it isn't enough. If what we make doesn't taste great and leave you feeling great, we won't make it. We think before we blend. How will our recipes work with body and mind? Health is found in nature. We work with what nature already offers rather than trying to concoct it. We don't have laboratories. We have kitchens. Creative combinations can optimize what nature has to offer. Ever added peppermint to ginger? They work together to produce a remarkably fresh and innovative taste, and a remarkably invigorating experience. Whenever possible, we work with wholes, not parts. We blend with whole spices and botanicals for their natural goodness - we don't supplement with vitamins and minerals. Yoga for Cheerful Well-Being: Lie on your back and place your hands under buttocks. Begin a bicycling motion, keeping legs in the air. Move feet in big circles and continue for 1 to 3 minutes. Then, take a few deep breaths and relax. Ahhhhh. Before doing this exercise or participating in any exercise program, consult your physician. Each tea bag contains approximately 58 mg of caffeine, as compared to approximately 90 mg in 8 oz of coffee. Certified Organic by QAI, Inc.

We work with what nature already offers rather than trying to concoct it. We don't have laboratories. We have kitchens. Creative combinations can optimize what nature has to offer. Ever added peppermint to ginger? They work together to produce a remarkably fresh and innovative taste, and a remarkably invigorating experience. Whenever possible, we work with wholes, not parts. We blend with whole spices and botanicals for their natural goodness - we don't supplement with vitamins and minerals. Yoga for Cheerful Well-Being: Lie on your back and place your hands under buttocks. Begin a bicycling motion, keeping legs in the air. Move feet in big circles and continue for 1 to 3 minutes. Then, take a few deep breaths and relax. Ahhhhh. Before doing this exercise or participating in any exercise program, consult your physician. Each tea bag contains approximately 58 mg of caffeine, as compared to approximately 90 mg in 8 oz of coffee. Certified Organic by QAI, Inc.

A distinctive blend with just the right amount of lemon and a dash of spice. All natural. America's classic. Family tea blenders since 1945. Our First Home: Where Bigelow Tea was born. Sometime in 1942 or '43, my mom and dad decided they wanted to start a tea business. At the time, we lived in a small apartment in Manhattan. They felt strongly that, for the company to be a success, they needed a home where they could begin. Searching the local streets, they found a brownstone, just off of Second Avenue, which was in terrible disrepair. Optimistic, they bought it with the last of their life savings, and replastered and repainted it themselves. It was in this home in 1945, where my mom and dad opened the doors to the new Bigelow Tea Company. Little could they have imagined that their dream would one day grow to be America's No. 1 specialty tea company! - David Bigelow. Unlock the Freshness - Here's the Key: We use a special foil pouch to protect your tea from any air, moisture and surrounding aromas.

Son Don't Tell Your Mother: Back in 1945, when the Bigelow Tea company first started, Ruth Bigelow and the family could only afford a single-color label for her tea. To help spruce up the package, David Jr. and David Sr. would sit together each night, hand-painting the two ladies on the original label. Each morning, they would put the tea into the family station wagon and sell it store by store. One night, David Sr. turned to David Jr. and said Son, don't tell your mother, but I don't think this company is ever going anywhere. Almost 70 years later, David Jr. still smiles at the memory, and is grateful that his father was mistaken. Today, Bigelow Tea is the specialty tea leader in the US.

Thank Goodness for that Little Jar: When Ruth Campbell Bigelow started Bigelow Tea in 1945, the going was tough. She had created a wonderful tea, Constant Comment, but now had to try to sell it, one store at a time. One day, she visited a store that had begun to successfully sell her tea. The shopkeeper shared with her that he had been opening up a container to allow his consumers to enjoy the tea's amazing aroma. One whiff and they were sold! he said. Ruth immediately started including in each case an extra little jar of Constant Comment labeled open and whiff. Shops across the country placed this whiffing jar by their cash registers. This would prove to be a defining moment that helped grow our family's tea company into the success it is today. Thanks goodness for that little jar! - The Bigelow Family. Unlock the freshness.

Bigelow Black Tea, English Teatime, Bags	20 tea bags [1.5 oz (42 g)]	Tea bags individually wrapped in foil pouches. Freshness stays in. Air and moisture stay out. A full bodied rich smooth tea perfect any time of day. All natural. America's classic. Family tea blenders since 1945. Thank goodness for that little jar - When Ruth Campbell Bigelow started Bigelow Tea in 1945, the going was tough. She had created a wonderful tea, Constant Comment, but now had to try to sell it, one store at a time. One day, she visited a store that had begun to successfully sell her tea. The shopkeeper shared with her that he had been opening up a container to allow his consumers to enjoy the tea's amazing aroma. One whiff and they were sold! he said. Ruth immediately started including in each case an extra little jar of Constant Comment labeled open and whiff. Shops across the country placed this whiffing jar by their cash registers. This would prove to be a defining moment that helped grow our family's tea company into the success it is today. Thank goodness for that little jar! - The Bigelow family. Unlock the Freshness - Here's the Key: We use a special foil pouch to protect your tea from any air, moisture and surrounding aromas.

If what we make doesn't taste great and leave you feeling great, we won't make it. We think before we blend. How will our recipes work with body and mind? Health is found in nature. We work with what nature already offers rather than trying to concoct it. We don't have laboratories. We have kitchens. Creative combinations can optimize what nature has to offer. Ever added peppermint to ginger? They work together to produce a remarkably fresh and innovative taste - and a remarkably invigorating experience. Whenever possible, we work with wholes, not parts. We blend with whole spices and botanicals for their natural goodness - we don't supplement with vitamins and minerals. Yoga to Invite Tranquility: Sit cross-legged or in a chair with feet flat. Rest your right elbow on right knee. Lean your right cheekbone on the palm of your right hand. Close your eyes and relax for 1 to 3 minutes. Your mind and body will thank you.

Personality: Gently nurturing and a friend of women. Herbal Power: Supports healthy menstruation, tones the uterus and may be used for menstrual cramps. Reason to Love: Of course, the delectable fruit of rubus idaeus is a well-known and well-loved summer treat, but it's the raspberry leaf you'll find in the this tea. With a silvery under leaf that is reminiscent of the moon's glow, European and Native American women have used raspberry leaf for thousands of years for menstrual support, menstrual cramps and during pregnancy as a healthy tonic to help prepare the womb for childbirth.

Bigelow Herbal Tea, Sweet Dreams, Caffeine Free, Bags	20 tea bags [1.09 oz (30 g)]	Tea bags individually wrapped in foil pouches. Freshness stays in. Air and moisture stay out. Blend of chamomile & mint to calm & soothe. All natural. America's classic. Family tea blenders since 1945. The Connecticut Tea Party: In 1955, Bigelow Tea moved from New York to Connecticut. Soon afterwards, back-to-back hurricanes hit! Connecticut rivers, including the Norwalk River, where the new factory resided, rose up over 35 feet, moving over 50 miles an hour. Ruth and David Bigelow worried desperately about their fledging 10 year old business. When they finally reached the factory, they saw their own version of the Connecticut Tea Party. The building was flooded and all of their tea had washed down the river. Although devastated, Ruth (in her 60's) and David (in his late 70's), were determined not to give up their dream. Turning to an employee, Ruth asked How long till we can get back in business? It took tremendous effort to get everything in order again. However, with the help of their creditors who extended them whatever they needed, the Bigelows were back in business in just a few months. Their tenacity is the foundation of what our company is built on. Our family learned two lessons that we still adhere to: always pay your bills on time, and when you get knocked down, just get right back up! - The Bigelow family. Unlock the Freshness - Here's the Key: We use a special foil pouch to protect your tea from any air, moisture and surrounding aromas.

See side panel for information about the relationship between canola oil and coronary heart disease. Good for your heart. Pure Wesson 100% Natural Canola Oil is the most versatile type of vegetable oil and it provides the best nutritional balance of all popular cooking oils.

First created by Dr. David Wesson in 1899, all Wesson oils are highly purified and contain zero grams of trans fatty acids per serving. Limited and not conclusive scientific evidence suggests that eating about 1-1/2 tablespoons of canola oil daily may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease due to the unsaturated fat content in canola oil. To achieve this possible benefit, canola oil is to replace a similar amount of saturated fat and not increase the total number of calories you eat in a day.

Questions or comments please call: 1-866-4-Mazola (4-629652). www.Mazola.com.

Excellent source of omega-3 ALA (contains 1112 mg per serving, which is 69% of the 1.6 g daily value for ALA). 0 g trans fat per serving. Cholesterol free. Canola oil is a cholesterol-free food with 14 g total fat per serving. Limited and not conclusive scientific evidence suggests that eating about 1-1/2 tablespoons (19 grams) of canola oil daily may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease due to the unsaturated fat content in canola oil. To achieve this possible benefit, canola oil is to replace a similar amount of saturated fat and not increase the total number of calories you eat in a day. One serving of this product contains 14 grams of canola oil. Good for your heart. Pure Wesson 100% Natural Canola Oil is the most versatile type of vegetable oil and it provides the best nutritional balance of all popular cooking oils. Wesson Canola Oil's light, delicate taste makes it the perfect oil to be used in every recipe that calls for vegetable oil.

Mazola Corn Oil, 100% Pure	16 fl oz (1 pt) 473 ml	Heart healthy. See side for information about the relationship between corn oil and heart disease.

ACH guarantees quality. Questions or comments please call: 1-866-4-Mazola (4-629652). www.Mazola.com. Very limited and preliminary scientific evidence suggests that eating about 1 tbsp (16 grams) of corn oil daily may reduce the risk of heart disease due to the unsaturated fat content in corn oil. FDA concluded there is little scientific evidence supporting this claim. To achieve this possible benefit, corn oil is to replace a similar amount of saturated fat and not increase the total number of calories you eat in a day.

Mazola Corn Oil, 100% Pure	64 fl oz (2 qt) 1.89 lt	Cholesterol free. Corn oil is a cholesterol free food with 14 g of total fat per serving. See nutrition information for fat and saturated fat content. 0 g trans fat per serving. Heart healthy. See back for information about the relationship between corn oil and heart disease. Very limited and preliminary scientific evidence suggests that eating about 1 tbsp (16 grams) of corn oil daily may reduce the risk of heart disease due to the unsaturated fat content in corn oil. FDA concluded there is little scientific evidence supporting this claim. To achieve this possible benefit, corn oil is to replace a similar amount of saturated fat and not increase the total number of calories you eat in a day. ACH guarantees quality.

Geraldines Cheese Straws, Baked, Aged Cheddar	4.5 oz (128 g)	My famous traditional southern recipe! All natural. It's how we entertain! Some years ago a Southern gentleman, Turner Holmes Cunningham, won the hand of Geraldine of Oaks, North Dakota, and whisked her off to his mini-plantation. Geraldine bore Turner Holmes three sturdy sons and one daughter, Catherine. Turner Holmes prospered and became high school principal, the most scrutinized position in town. One weekend when Catherine's youth had reached full flower, the elder Cunninghams journeyed to Atlanta. Catherine opened their home to the young ladies and gentlemen of Newnan where she served her mother's cheese straws made from a secret recipe. The party promptly became the wildest festivity that the fair town had ever witnessed. When the Cunninghams returned, the town was in an uproar over the irreparable damage that had been wreaked upon its youth. How to save the day? Geraldine knew the power of her cheese straws. People have been known to bargain with the devil to get their lips around just one. She baked her delicate fingers to the bone. The children went door-to-door delivering those potent little peace offerings. After a few bites the townspeople not only forgave the Cunninghams, but found themselves dancing wildly in the town square. So if you want to turn your dignified gathering into a get down bash, serve up Geraldine's Bodacious Cheese Straws. No preservatives. What makes Geraldine's Cheese Straws so bodacious? It's all about the cheese! Look at the ingredient list. Our No. 1 item is Cheese. Most cheese snacks have flour as the first ingredient. Geraldine's uses premium quality cheese, lots of it, mixed with other all natural ingredients then baked crisp for a truly Bodacious taste sensation. It's the ultimate cheese snack!

Coconut Secret Coconut Aminos, Raw	8 fl oz (237 ml)	Soy-free seasoning sauce. 65% less sodium than soy sauce. 100% organic. Gluten-free. Dairy-free. GMO-free. USDA organic. Non GMO project verified. High source of aminos. The Coconut Secret Story: When both our parents learned they were diabetic, my brother and I were deeply inspired to search the world for pure, raw, truly delicious, low glycemic products. We were rewarded and blessed beyond expectations, in our discovery of the traditional products made from the sap of the wondrous coconut tree. It is our great joy to be able to share with you the gifts of these exceptional ingredients. - Leslie and Randy. Health Secrets of Coconut Aminos: When the coconut tree is tapped it produces a highly nutrient rich sap that exudes from the coconut blossoms. This sap is raw, very low glycemic, an abundant source of 17 amino acids, minerals, vitamins, and has a nearly neutral pH. A comparison between coconut tree sap and soy, shows that coconut sap contains 2-14 times the amino acid content of soy. Small batches ensure that our organic, low glycemic Coconut Aminos, made from this natural sap, is a raw enzymatically alive product aged and blended with sun dried, mineral-rich sea salt, hand gathered from pristine waters near the southern islands of the Philippine coast. Recipe Tips: Soy-Free Seasoning alternative for use like soy sauce in salad dressings, marinades, sautes, and with sushi! This delicious product does not have a coconutty flavor.

A comparison between coconut tree sap and soy, shows that coconut sap contains 2-14 times the amino acid content of soy. Small batches ensure that our organic, low glycemic Coconut Aminos, made from this natural sap, is a raw enzymatically alive product aged and blended with sun dried, mineral-rich sea salt, hand gathered from pristine waters near the southern islands of the Philippine coast. Recipe Tips: Soy-Free Seasoning alternative for use like soy sauce in salad dressings, marinades, sautes, and with sushi! This delicious product does not have a coconutty flavor. Certified organic by OCIA. Product of the Philippines.	http://www.publix.com/images/products/955000/957325-600x600-A.jpg

Bessingers Bar-Be-Que Sauce, Original Golden Recipe	19 oz (568 g)	The Gold Standard of Bar-Be-Que: Bar-be-que is something we southerners take very seriously, and here in the Lowcountry of South Carolina we love our mustard-based bar-be-que sauce. Our bar-be-que sauce is a touch of bar-be-que heaven, and we have the awards to prove it. My father, Big Joe Bessinger, created this delicious bar-be-que sauce back in the 1930's and ever since he - and now I - have packed 'em into our restaurants for that heavenly taste. You might not have the time or the equipment to make bar-be-que like we do, but with a jar of Thomas Bessinger's Original Golden Recipe, you can come pretty close.

Marinate any cut for an hour - longer for more flavor. Baste with fresh marinade as you grill or bake. Also great in slow cookers, stir-frys and skillets. Certified gluten-free. Texas.

Grace Jerk Rub, Jamaican, Mild	10 oz (284 g)	Quality since 1922. Ideal for seasoning fish, seafood, meat & vegetables. Centuries ago, necessity forced the Maroon peoples in the mountains of Jamaica to develop a method to preserve and season meat. Thus was born a way of food preparation called jerk that today defines one distinct element of the Jamaican culinary experience. Jerked chicken, pork, fish and vegetables are equally at home around the backyard grill, at the street dance, on the beach and as part of an elegantly served white glove experience. Today, that unique combination of escallions, ginger, scotch bonnet peppers, all-spice, garlic and nutmeg that is the basis of jerk cooking, comes to you perfectly blended, ready to use as you create in your own home, the authentic Jamaican jerk experience. www.gracefoods.com.

Buds Best Cookies Cookies, Chocolate Chip, Bite Size	6 oz (170 g)	Lots of real chocolate chips! Little cookie. Big taste. Cookies are in my blood. As a boy of 12 years old, working in my aunt's bakery, I knew that someday I wanted to own my own cookie factory. I've now been in the cookie business for more than forty years. My vision and dream of building the most modern cookie plant in the world came true in 1991. Of course, I've seen a lot of changes over the years - from selling cookies out of a jar for a penny each, to producing over a million cookies per hour. We even offer tours through the plant on our Cookie Train, so you can see for yourself how Bud's Best Cookies are made. But, besides their delicious taste, perhaps one of the greatest things about Bud's Best Cookies is they're bite-sized! That means they're perfect for kids of all ages. Because of our commitment to give our customers the highest quality cookies at the lowest possible price, you have my word - Bud's Best is the best! - Bud Carson.

Alessi Biscotti Savoiardi Lady Fingers	7 oz (200 g)	Perfect for tiramisu. Savoiardi, commonly known as Lady Fingers, are delightful and delicately light cookies from Italy that have been enjoyed by Italians for generations. Eaten as a snack alongside a glass of milk, children love their simple goodness. Adults too enjoy nibbling on them between sips of espresso or cappuccino. The Italians have invented wonderous desserts using them in creations like Tiramisu. Tiramisu is an Italian delight that has of late become a most fashionable dessert. Its origins have been traced back to Siena where it had been called Zuppa Del Duca or The Duke's Soup. The dessert became very popular in Florence in the nineteenth century where the English people who lived in the town renamed it Zuppa Inglese or English Soup. The dessert has several variations and has always enjoyed great popularity over the years regardless of the name. Made with mascarpone cheese, delicate lady fingers and laced with strong espresso coffee, Tiramisu literally translates to pick me up which refers to the inevitable energizing boost this dessert will provide. www.alessifoods.com.

Buds Best Cookies Cookies, Pecan Supremes, Bite Size	6 oz (170 g)	Little cookie. Big taste. Cookies are in my blood. As a boy of 12 years old, working in my aunt's bakery, I knew that someday I wanted to own my own cookie factory. I've now been in the cookie business for more than forty years. My vision and dream of building the most modern cookie plant in the world came true in 1991. Of course, I've seen a lot of changes over the years - from selling cookies out of a jar for a penny each, to producing over a million cookies per hour. We even offer tours through the plant on our Cookie Train, so you can see for yourself how Bud's Best Cookies are made. But, besides their delicious taste, perhaps one of the greatest things about Bud's Best Cookies is they're bite-sized! That means they're perfect for kids of all ages. Because of our commitment to give our customers the highest quality cookies at the lowest possible price, you have my word: Bud's Best is the best! - Bud Carson.

Buds Best Cookies Cookies, Ginger Snaps, Old Fashioned	6 oz (170 g)	Cookies are in my blood. As a boy of 12 years old, working in my aunt's bakery, I knew that someday I wanted to own my own cookie factory. I've now been in the cookie business for more than fifty-five years. My vision and dream of building the most modern cookie plant in the world came true in 1991. Of course, I've seen a lot of changes over the years - from selling cookies out of a jar for a penny each, to producing over a million cookies per hour. We even offer tours through the plant on our Cookie Train, so you can see for yourself how Bud's Best Cookies are made. But, besides their delicious taste, perhaps one of the greatest things about Bud's Best Cookies is they're bite-sized! That means they're perfect for kids of all ages. Because of our commitment to give our customers the highest quality cookies at the lowest possible price, you have my word: Bud's Best is the best! - Bud Carson. Facebook: Become our fan on Facebook.

Buds Best Cookies Cookies, Vanilla Cremes, Bite Size	6 oz (170 g)	Little cookie. Big taste. Cookies are in my blood. As a boy of 12 years old, working in my aunt's bakery, I knew that someday I wanted to own my own cookie factory. I've now been in the cookie business for more than 40 years. My vision and dream of building the most modern cookie plant in the world came true in 1991. Of course, I've seen a lot of changes over the years - from selling cookies out of a jar for a penny each, to producing over a million cookies per hour. We even offer tours through the plant on our Cookie Train, so you can see for yourself how Bud's Best Cookies are made. But besides their delicious taste, perhaps one of the greatest things about Bud's Best Cookies is they're bite-sized! That means they're perfect for kids of all ages.

Buds Best Cookies Cookies, Oatmeal, Bite Size	6 oz (170 g)	Made with California raisins. Little cookie. Big taste. Cookies are in my blood. As a boy of 12 years old, working in my aunt's bakery, I knew that someday I wanted to own my own cookie factory. I've now been in the cookie business for more than forty years. My vision and dream of building the most modern cookie plant in the world came true in 1991. Of course, I've seen a lot of changes over the years - from selling cookies out of a jar for a penny each, to producing over a million cookies per hour. We even offer tours through the plant on our Cookie Train, so you can see for yourself how Bud's Best Cookies are made. But, besides their delicious taste, perhaps one of the greatest things about Bud's Best Cookies is they're bite-sized! That means they're perfect for kids of all ages.

Buds Best Cookies Cookies, Strawberry Cremes, Bite Size	6 oz (170 g)	Little cookie. Big taste. Cookies are in my blood. As a boy of 12 years old, working in my aunt's bakery, I knew that someday I wanted to own my own cookie factory. I've now been in the cookie business for more than forty years. My vision and dream of building the most modern cookie plant in the world came true in 1991. Of course, I've seen a lot of changes over the years - from selling cookies out of a jar for a penny each, to producing over a million cookies per hour. We even offer tours through the plant on our Cookie Train, so you can see for yourself how Bud's Best Cookies are made. But, besides their delicious taste, perhaps one of the greatest things about Bud's Best Cookies is they're bite-sized! That means they're perfect for kids of all ages. Because of our commitment to give our customers the highest quality cookies at the lowest possible price, you have my word: Bud's Best is the best! - Bud Carson.

Buds Best Cookies Cookies, Chocolate Chip Pecan Supremes, Bite Size	6 oz (170 g)	Little cookie. Big taste. Cookies are in my blood. As a boy of 12 years old, working in my aunt's bakery, I knew that someday I wanted to own my own cookie factory. I've now been in the cookie business for more than forty years. My vision and dream of building the most modern cookie plant in the world came true in 1991. Of course, I've seen a lot of changes over the years - from selling cookies out of a jar for a penny each, to producing over a million cookies per hour. We even offer tours through the plant on our Cookie Train, so you can see for yourself how Bud's Best Cookies are made. But, besides their delicious taste, perhaps one of the greatest things about Bud's Best Cookies is they're bite-sized! That means they're perfect for kids of all ages. Because of our commitment to give our customers the highest quality cookies at the lowest possible price, you have my word: Bud's Best is the best! - Bud Carson.

Newmans Own Organics The Second Generation Cookies, Fig Newmans	10 oz (283 g)	Fruit filled cookies made with organic figs. Wheat free. Dairy free. Not a gluten-free product. A Figurative Theory: I think most people know about Adam and Eve's blunder in the garden, but my Pop has developed his own theory. I was in the middle of a peaceful breakfast when Pop bounded up the stairs with a sixty pound crate of ancient scrolls, talking to himself. It wasn't the apple, it was the figs, the figs! I stayed motionless hoping he'd wander off and talk to one of the dogs, when his hand reached out to stop me from eating my oatmeal. Nellie, these scrolls confirm my theory. When Adam and Eve used the fig leaves to cover up their own embarrassment and tossed the precious figs in the dirt, their act in the garden was cancelled. With one hand over my teacup and the other shaking my oatmeal spoon, he concluded his biblical theory, the apple incident, as far as I am concerned, was nothing compared to their wanton waste of the figs.

As a mom of four boys, I've always been passionate about home cooked meals that are delicious, nutritious, whole and organic. I strongly feel that dessert should be no exception. After weeks of researching the best of organic, gluten-free, kosher and non-GMO flours, nuts, fruits, dark chocolates, eggs and butter, my first winner was born - Chocolate Chip Love - an insanely delicious, gluten-free twist on a classic chocolate chip cookie. My boys and husband raved over them. And so, ginnybakes was born! Today, my first batch of cookies has grown into a line of gluten-free, organic or all natural, kosher, fresh baked cookies, biscottis, bars and bake mixes for everyone to enjoy. I am proud to say ginnybakes are free of preservatives, chemicals and refined sugars. Always looking for ways to enhance and improve fresh baked goods, I will continue to expand our vegan line, while also being conscious of the imminent importance of non-GMO products. I offer these from my heart with love and passion. XO Ginny. Paperboard packaging recyclable. SFI Certified sourcing. www.sfiprogram.org. Chocolate lovers rejoice!

Buds Best Cookies Cookies, Sandwich, Caco Chocolate, Bite Size	6 oz (170 g)	Little cookie. Big taste. Cookies are in my blood. As a boy of 12 years old, working in my aunt's bakery, I knew that someday I wanted to own my own cookie factory. I've now been in the cookie business for more than forty years. My vision and dream of building the most modern cookie plant in the world came true in 1991. Of course, I've seen a lot of changes over the years - from selling cookies out of a jar for a penny each, to producing over a million cookies per hour. We even offer tours through the plant on our Cookie Train, so you can see for yourself how Bud's Best Cookies are made. But, besides their delicious taste, perhaps one of the greatest things about Bud's Best Cookies is they're bite-sized! That means they're perfect for kids of all ages. Because of our commitment to give our customers the highest quality cookies at the lowest possible price, you have my word: Bud's Best is the best! - Bud Carson.

Goodie Girl Cookies, Oatmeal Raisin	6 oz (170 g)	Just the right amount of wrong. Naturally gluten-free. Certified gluten-free. Somewhere between my decade-long career in punk rock PR, a stint as a fashion model, and raising three kids, I decided that my true talent was the creative mastery of the perfect dose of sugar! So I traded in my cool career to haul thousands of pounds of rice flour to the mixer! I took the best version of a classic cookie and carefully rebuilt it to taste even better than the original by trading the most harmful and punishing ingredients such as hydrogenated fats and preservatives [even gluten!], with better-for-us ingredients. You can make a better tasting cookie without the junk. And trust me, when you gotta have something sweet, a Goodie Girl cookie is Just the right amount of wrong!

ginnybakes Cookies, Chocolate Chip Love	5.5 oz (157 g)	Fresh baked. Organic. Gluten-free. Outrageously delicious cookies baked with love and passion. USDA organic. GF: Certified Gluten free. Indulge organically! It started with a dream. In 2009, I graduated from the Institute of Integrative Nutrition as a holistic nutritionist. Based on my education and passion for healthy living, I had a dream creating a line of desserts for people who have a love for clean, organic foods, a healthy lifestyle and a sweet tooth for one of life's greatest indulgences - fresh baked treats! As a mom of four boys, I've always been passionate about home cooked meals that are delicious, nutritious, whole and organic. I strongly feel that dessert should be no exception. After weeks of researching the best of organic, gluten-free, kosher and non-GMO flours, nuts, fruits, dark chocolates, eggs and butter, my first winner was born - Chocolate Chip Love - an insanely delicious, gluten free twist on a classic chocolate chip cookie. My boys and husband raved over them. And so, ginnybakes was born! Today, my first batch of cookies has grown into a line of gluten-free, organic or all natural, kosher, fresh baked cookies, biscottis, bars and bake mixes for everyone to enjoy. I am proud to say ginnybakes are free of preservatives, chemicals and refined sugars. Always looking for ways to enhance and improve fresh baked goods, I will continue to expand our vegan line, while also being conscious of the imminent importance of non-GMO products. I offer these from my heart with love and passion. - xo ginny. Paperboard packaging - Recyclable. SFI - certified sourcing. www.sfiprogram.org.

Newmans Own Organics The Second Generation Cookies, Fig Newmans	10 oz (283 g)	Fruit filled cookies made with organic figs. Low fat. Nell Newman. Pa Newman. A figurative theory. I think most people know about Adam and Eve's blunder in the garden, but my pop has developed his own theory. I was in the middle of a peaceful breakfast when pop bounded up the stairs with a sixty pound crate of ancient scrolls, talking to himself. It wasn't the apple, it was the figs, the figs! I stayed motionless hoping he'd wander off and talk to one of the dogs, when his hand reached out to stop me from eating my oatmeal. Nellie, these scrolls confirm my theory. When Adam and Eve used the fig leaves to cover their own embarrassment and tossed the precious figs in the dirt, their act in the garden was cancelled. With one hand over my teacup and the other shaking my oatmeal spoon, he concluded his biblical theory, The apple incident, as far as I am concerned, was nothing compared to their wanton waste of the figs. This is why my pop reveres the fig and I like to eat breakfast in my room. For my pop's sake, I hope you, too, will revel in the divine quality of our Fig Newmans - Sincerely, Nell Newman. PS - The enjoyment of our Fig Newmans doesn't require an allegiance to my pop's theory. Certified organic by Oregon Tilth. Cookies made in USA.Show Lessop me from eating my oatmeal.

ginnybakes Cookies, Dreamy Vegan Delight	5.5 oz (157 g)	Outrageously delicious cookies baked with love and passion. Fresh baked. Organic. Gluten-free. USDA organic. Indulge organically! It Started With a Dream. In 2009, I graduated from the Institute of Integrative Nutrition as a holistic nutritionist. Based on my education and passion for healthy living, I had a dream of creating a line of desserts for people who have a love for clean, organic foods, a healthy lifestyle and a sweet tooth for one of life's greatest indulgences - fresh baked treats! As a mom of four boys, I've always been passionate about home cooked meals that are delicious, nutritious, whole and organic. I strongly feel that dessert should be no exception. After weeks of researching the best of organic, gluten-free, kosher and non-GMO flours, nuts, fruits, dark chocolates, eggs and butter, my first winner was born - Chocolate Chip Love - an insanely delicious, gluten-free twist on a classic chocolate chip cookie. My boys and husband raved over them. And so, ginnybakes was born! Today, my first batch of cookies has grown into a line of gluten-free, organic or all natural, kosher, fresh baked cookies, biscottis, bars and bake mixes for everyone to enjoy. I am proud to say ginnybakes are free of preservatives, chemicals and refined sugars. Always looking for ways to enhance and improve fresh baked goods, I will continue to expand our vegan line, while also being conscious of the imminent importance of non-GMO products. I offer these from my heart with love and passion. XO Ginny. Paperboard packaging recyclable. SFI Certified sourcing. www.sfiprogram.org. When coconut and dreamy vanilla meet - oh my goodness! Created with love for our vegan (and non-vegan) friends, the flavors meld and scrumptiously announce themselves in a most delectable way. Fall in love and indulge organically with ginnybakes! Ginnybakes are formulated to avoid genetically engineered ingredients. US law does not allow the use of genetically engineered ingredients or seed in products labeled as organic.
