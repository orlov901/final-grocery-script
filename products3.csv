Kodiak Cakes Flapjack and Waffle Mix, Power Cakes, Buttermilk, Protein Packed	20 oz (1 lb 4 oz) 567 g	100% whole grains. Add water only. Non-GMO, no preservatives. 14 g protein. 5 g fiber. Whole grains taste better. A portion of sales donated to grizzly bear and wildlife conservation. Whole Grain: 36 g or more per serving. Eat 48 g or more of whole grains daily. WholeGrainsCouncil.org. Made with freshly ground grains and no preservatives. Restoring the Flapjack Tradition: Long ago, flapjacks were the hearty mainstay of frontiersmen from the frigid Yukon to the High Sierra. These rugged mountain-men and homesteaders relied on a traditional flapjack that combined the rich, substantial taste of whole grain wheat with the light, mellow taste of whole grain oats. Those trailblazers had stumbled onto a superb nutritional combination. Their flapjacks contained a powerful source of carbohydrates, protein and fiber with very little fat. Today, few people know that the frontier flapjack and the ordinary pancake are not the same. At Baker Mills, we set out to restore the flapjack tradition with Kodiak Cakes. Our time-honored family recipe harkens back to another time and spans many generations. Kodiak Cakes were finally introduced to the world one summer day in 1982 when Penny Clark to mixed together the ingredients for her father's flapjack recipe to sell to eager friends and neighbors. She packed the mixes in brown paper lunch sacks, placed them in her eight-year-old son's red wagon, and sent him off into the neighborhood. In no time, he returned home with an empty wagon having sold every mix. From a little red wagon, to the best selling whole grain flapjack mix in the nation, Kodiak Cakes have come a long way. Yet the recipe continues to stay true to the old fashioned flapjack of years past because of our steadfast commitment to use only whole grains and all-natural ingredients. Kodiak Cakes are not for the faint-hearted, but for those of us who, like the old frontiersmen exploring and settling untamed wilderness, require nutrition, vitality, and taste. Power Cakes Flapjack & Waffle Mix can be used as a healthy alternative in recipes. Simply substitute 1 cup flour with 1 cup Kodiak Cakes Mix and omit salt and baking powder.

Our product lien is diverse and extensive. For information and recipes, visit our website at www.bobsredmill.com. Diets rich in whole grain foods and other plant foods low in total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease and certain cancers. Dear friends, We would like to share with you the importance of including whole grain foods in your diet. A whole grain includes all three parts of the grain kernel: the bran, endosperm and germ. Whole grains have long been over-generalized as just a good source of dietary fiber, but they also contain important vitamins, minerals, and hundreds of unique phytochemicals. Recent scientific research has discovered that the benefits of eating whole grains come from the synergistic effects of the fiber, vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals - not just the individual components. They all work together to offer health benefits that are greater than the sum of the parts. Exactly how they work together is uncertain, but studies clearly show that including whole grains in your diet may reduce your risk of certain chronic diseases. Certain Cancers: Scientific evidence suggests that a diet including whole grains reduces the risks for some cancers, especially gastrointestinal cancers. Heart Disease: Antioxidants contained in whole grains may work with fiber and other compounds to reduce your overall risk of heart disease. So for your good health, start eating at least three servings of whole grain foods every day. My Bob's Red Mill 10 Grain Pancake & Waffle Mix is a delicious way to include them in your diet. It carries my highest endorsement. To your good health, - Bob Moore. Made in the USA.Show LessOur product lien is diverse and extensive.

Kodiak Cakes Flapjack and Waffle Mix, Frontier, Original	24 oz (1 lb 8 oz) 680 g	Whole wheat, oat & honey. Celebrating 20 years. Add water only. No added fat, cholesterol or sugar. Great for baking recipes at www.kodiakcakes.com. Whole grains taste better. A portion of sales donated to grizzly bear and wildlife conservation. Restoring the flapjack tradition. Long ago, flapjacks were the hearty mainstay of frontiersmen from the frigid Yukon to the High Sierra. These rugged mountain-men and homesteaders relied on a traditional flapjack that combined the rich, substantial taste of whole grain wheat with the light, mellow taste of whole grain oats. Those trailblazers had stumbled onto a superb nutritional combination. Their flapjacks contained a powerful source of carbohydrates, protein and fiber with very little fat. Today, few people know that the frontier flapjack and the ordinary pancake are not the same. At Baker Mills, we set out to restore the flapjack tradition with Kodiak Cakes. Our time-honored family recipe harkens back to another time and spanned many generations. Kodiak Cakes were finally introduced to the world one summer day in 1982 when Penny Clark decided to mix together the ingredients for her father's flapjack recipe to sell to eager friends and neighbors. She packed the mixes in brown paper lunch sacks, placed them in her eight-year-old son's red wagon, and sent him off into the neighborhood. In no time, he returned home with an empty wagon having sold every mix. From a little red wagon, to the best selling whole grain flapjack mix in the nation, Kodiak Cakes have come a long way. Yet the recipe continues to stay true to the old-fashioned flapjack of years past because of our steadfast commitment to use only whole grains and all-natural ingredients. Kodiak Cakes are not for the faint-hearted, but for those of us who, like the old frontiersmen exploring and settling untamed wildernesses, require nutrition, vitality, and taste. Kodiak Cakes Flapjack & Waffle Mix can be used as a healthy alternative in recipes. Simply substitute 1 cup flour with 1 cup Kodiak Cakes Mix and omit salt and baking powder. For more recipes visit www.kodiakcakes.com. Instagram at kodiakcakes, hashtag kodiakcakes. Twitter at kodiakcakes. Facebook kodiakcakes. YouTube kodiakcakes. www.kodiakcakes.com.

Box Tops for Education. Same Cheerios, Simply Gluten Free: The real honey taste you love has always come with oats that are naturally gluten free. We're simply making sure they stay that way. It Starts with Family: When Phil, a member of the Cheerios team for over 50 years, found out his daughter-in-law couldn't eat gluten, he knew his team had to find a way to make sure every family, including his, could share breakfast together. Since oats are naturally gluten free, the only problem was finding a way to make sure they didn't get mixed up with anything else. What we put in: oats. What we sort out: wheat; rye; barley. The Journey from Field to Bowl: Most of the farmers who grow oats for Cheerios also grow wheat and barley, which aren't gluten free. Sometimes, those grains get mixed together in the field or on the farm, so, to make Cheerios gluten free, we had to separate them. It took a lot of late nights and hard work, but we finally discovered a way to sort the other grains out of our oats. Cheerios for Everyone: We know there are lots of families out there who don't want to let dietary restrictions get in the way of spending time together. Now that Honey Nut Cheerios are gluten free, more families than ever can sit down to share the taste of real honey and oats, and we couldn't be happier.

Working with Nature: Cascadian Farm Roots: The story of Cascadian Farms starts over 40 years ago with Gene Kahn. Gene was an idealistic, 24-year-old graduate school dropout who wanted to make a difference in the world. Concerned about industrial farming's impact on our food and ecosystem, Gene was determined to help restore faith in food. So he founded a small, organic farm on a little stretch of land in beautiful Skagit Valley, Washington. That farm quickly grew and became a pioneer in the burgeoning organic food industry. Today, Cascadian Farm has grown well beyond the Home Farm, but Gene's mission continues: to bring you delicious, organic food you can believe in. Why We Go Organic: Why is organic so important to us? Simple. It's good for people and good for the environment. Organic farmers work with nature to build rich, healthy soil and preserve biodiversity and critical water resources. Organic farming also means crops are grown without the use of genetic engineering (GMOs) or synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. By eating organic, we not only limit our exposure to these synthetic chemicals but also respect and utilize nature's rich ecosystem. It's food just the way it should be. Visit Our Home Farm: We've outgrown our home farm in Skagit Valley, but you can still visit the place where it all started! Plan a trip and stop by our farm stand for a pint of our fresh, seasonal berries or homemade organic ice cream. If you aren't in the area, take an interactive virtual tour at CascadianFarm.com/farmtour. Open May-October. Cascadian Farm Home Farm, 55749 State Route 20, Rockport, WA 98283. Help us save the bees!

Dear Friends, You may notice some changes to the ingredient and nutrition details in our GoLean cereal and we want to share the full story behind them. First of all, we're proud to say that GoLean Original is now Non-GMO Project verified. In fact, ALL of our Kashi GoLean cereals are now Non-GMO Project verified. And we're working hard to have every Kashi product Non-GMO Project verified over the course of the year. Secondly, we're taking a different approach to harnessing the nutritional power of soy. It's called expeller pressing, and it's a method of simply squeezing the oils out of soybeans and using the protein that's left behind. While this approach is pretty simple, it's also a less efficient way to get protein, which resulted in a different serving size along with some differences in protein, fiber and sugar per serving. Finally, while you may find GoLean is a bit less sweet, we think you'll agree that it still tastes delicious and delivers an amazing combination of plant-based protein and fiber. We feel really positive about these changes and hope you do too. - Sincerely, The Kashi Team. We'd love to hear from you! If you'd like to know more or have any questions or feedback, please drop us a line at Kashi.com or on Facebook. Kashi eat positive.

Working with Nature: Organic Farming & Pests: How we grow our food matters. That's why organic farmers use nature as an ally in their farming practices. When it comes to dealing with pests, organic farmers don't rely on synthetic pesticides. Rather, by fostering habitat for beneficial insects that prey on crop pests or by rotating crops to break crop pest cycles, organic farmers use the natural food web to help protect their crops. The result is a natural pest management system that is good for crops and good for the environment. It's agriculture through nature, bringing us food just the way it should be. Why We Go Organic: Why is organic so important to us? Simple. It's good for people and good for the environment. Organic farmers work with nature to build rich, healthy soil and preserve biodiversity and critical water resources. Organic farming also means crops are grown without the use of genetic engineering (GMOs) of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. By eating organic, we not only limit our exposure to these synthetic chemicals but also respect and utilize nature's rich ecosystem. It's food just the way it should be. Visit Our Home Farm: We've outgrown our Home Farm in Skagit Valley, but you can still visit the place where it all started!

Help us save the bees! Did You Know - Bees are responsible for the pollination of over two-thirds of the world's agriculture crops?

For over 25 years, it's been our mission to provide great tasting, all natural foods to help you live well. That's why we made our Heart to Heart foods with more heart healthy ingredients to: Help Support Healthy Cholesterol: Since high cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease, diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol that include 3 grams of soluble fiber per day from whole grain oats and oat bran may reduce the risk of heart disease. One serving of Heart to Heart cereal provides 1 gram of soluble oat fiber. This type of fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like material and as it passes through the digestive system, it binds with cholesterol, removing it from your body. Good sources of soluble fiber include whole grains like oats, brown rice and barley, beans, peas, fruits and vegetables. Help Promote Healthy Blood Pressure: High blood pressure is another major risk factor for heart disease. Sodium is important to the body, but a high sodium diet is associated with hypertension. Diets low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure, a disease associated with many risk factors. That's why we made sure Heart to Heart cereal is a low sodium breakfast choice. More For You: Each serving of Heart to Heart cereal is high in antioxidant vitamins C and E. Plus, you'll get 100% daily value of heart healthy vitamins B6, B12 and folic acid.

Our family of heart healthy yummy products! From Our Heart to Yours: At Kashi, The Seven Whole Grain Company, we believe everyone has the power to make positive, healthy lifestyle changes. For over 25 years, it's been our mission to provide great tasting, all natural foods to help you live well. That's why we made our Heart to Heart foods with more heart healthy ingredients to: Help Support Healthy Cholesterol: Since high cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease, diets low in saturated fat and cholesterol that include 3 grams of soluble fiber per day from whole grain oats and oat bran may reduce the risk of heart disease. One serving of Heart to Heart cereal provides 1 gram of soluble oat fiber. This type of fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like material and as it passes through the digestive system, it binds with cholesterol, removing it from your body. Good sources of soluble fiber include whole grains like oats, brown rice and barley, beans, peas, fruits and vegetables. Help Promote Healthy Blood Pressure: High blood pressure is another major risk factor for heart disease. Sodium is important to the body, but a high sodium diet is associated with hypertension. Diets low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure, a disease associated with many risk factors. That's why we made sure Heart to Heart cereal is a low sodium breakfast choice. More For You: Each serving of Heart to Heart cereal is high in antioxidant vitamins C and E. Plus, you'll get 100% daily value of heart healthy vitamins B6, B12 and folic acid.

Kashi Cereal, Dark Cocoa Karma	16.1 oz (456 g)	Shredded wheat biscuits with cocoa & cinnamon. Made with transitional wheat. New! Non GMO Project verified. nongmoproject.org. Transitional certified by QAI. Fair Trade certified cocoa. 6 g fiber. Contents may settle. Product sold by weight not volume. Newton Russell, looking out on his transitional fields in eastern Wyoming. This cereal is not organic. But hang on. That's the point. The truth is, less than 1% of farmland in the US is certified organic and transitioning conventional farmland to organic is difficult. Farmers like Newton often want to do it but they have to implement more costly methods for at least three years to become certified. And while that's good for all of us, it means farms don't see a return on their investment immediately, and they may be less motivated to make the change. So, let's do something about it. The Kashi Transitional Farms Initiative was created so together we can help farmers like Newton transition their farmland. During Newton's three-year conversion process, we're buying some of his transitional grains - which are certified by Quality Assurance International to ensure they are grown using sustainable practices that avoid genetically modified seed and synthetic pesticides or fertilizers. And we use them to make this cereal. Our hope is to convert more acreage every year - which is why our certified transitional cereals will always be made with transitional grains. The more we all become aware, the more farmers we can help to make a difference together. Thanks for joining us. Transitional Certified by QAI - Look for the mark of the movement.

GreenWise Cereal, Organic, Toasted Oats	15 oz (425 g)	We'd like to propose a toast to toasted oats. They're so crunchy and delicious, each spoonful turning your mouth into a bite-sized utopia of yummy goodness. So let's all raise a bowl. Then raise this box. Then tilt this box. Then, well, you see where this is going. Organic. USDA organic. What More Can We Say? Plenty if we're talking about whole grain oat flour. It contributes to this cereal being low in fat, and totally cholesterol free. We'd keep going, but we're out of space. What's Sweeter than Sugar? Knowing that the sugar of this cereal is beautifully unrefined, deliciously full-flavored organic cane sugar. That's what. With Sea Salt, Less is More: Some estimate that spreading all the ocean's salt evenly across the land would create a 500-foot layer of sea salt. Fortunately, a much smaller amount brings out big flavor in this cereal. We know you care about what you put into your body. We hope you care just as much about what you put into the environment.

Bobs Red Mill Muesli, Old Country Style	18 oz (1 lb 2 oz) 510 g	An employee-owned company. To your good health. - Bob Moore. Hot or cold cereal. Whole grain. Wholesome. Nutritious. Whole Grain: 17 g or more per serving. Eat 48 g or more of whole grains daily. WholeGrainsCouncil.org. Resealable package. Dear friends, many years ago, my wife Charlee and I stayed at a beautiful bed and breakfast in the Scottish countryside. One morning, our hostess served us the most amazing cereal. It was full of rolled grains, nuts, seeds and dried fruit. This was my first contact with the traditional European cereal known as muesli. A quick bit of history: muesli was invented over a century ago by a Swiss doctor who was way ahead of his time when it came to understanding the health benefits of whole grains. He made all of his patients eat muesli every day, and they loved it! I enjoyed that muesli so much that I was inspired to make my very own version of this nutritious cereal. I started with a combination of five flavorful rolled grains - oats, wheat, barley, rye and triticale. Then I added sweet dates and raisins, crunchy sunflower seeds, almond slices and walnut pieces. Finally, for an extra boost of nutrition, I topped it off with a good handful of flaxseed meal. Voila! Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli was born. Whether you eat it hot, cold, or soaked in yogurt overnight (the traditional Swiss way), I just know you will enjoy this wholesome cereal. To your good health, - Bob Moore. Perfectly Simple Cereal: Our muesli is wonderfully tasty and nourishing! What makes this cereal so great? It's Perfectly Simple: whole grains provide nutritious fiber; dried fruit adds a touch of wholesome sweetness; nuts and seeds bring pleasant flavor and crunch. Still hungry?

Learn, play & get rewards at www.Barbaras.com/WildRewards. Puffin Trivia: Did you know that puffins can sit on your breakfast table? Puffins are usually 10 inches tall, which is about the height of a quart of milk. Puffins can see underwater to catch fish. They have special nictitating membrane eye covers which they can close while swimming. These function like goggles and even have a clear patch in the center to help them focus. Puffins can drink salt water and separate the salty brine in their salt glands, located over their eyes. The extra salt dribbles out of their nostrils. Puffin eggs are creamy white, sometimes with a lilac-colored pattern. To watch Puffins on the loafing ledge or in a chick burrow via live HD cams, visit our friends at explore.org. www.explore.org/puffins.

Whole Grain: 47 g or more per serving. Eat 48 g or more of whole grains daily. WholeGrainsCouncil.org. As described in the Holy Scriptures: Take also unto thee wheat and barley and beans and lentils and millet and spelt and put them in one vessel and made bread of it. - Ezekiel 4:9. Certified organic grains. The live grain difference! Did You Know? Food For Life Ezekiel 4:9 sprouted grain crunchy cereals are made from sprouted organic live grains, legumes, and seeds, and contain absolutely no flour. Sprouting is the only way to release all of the vital nutrients stored in whole grains. We add just the right amount of water to healthy, whole, organically grown grains to unlock dormant food energy and maximize nutrition and flavor. Beneficial enzymes are activated which cause the grains to sprout and become a living food. The enzymatic action increases valuable nutrients and also causes a natural change that promotes a more efficient assimilation of protein and carbohydrates. Our exclusive slow baking technique helps preserve valuable nutrients and retain important natural fiber and bran. Your body and taste buds will know the difference. The natural whole grain goodness and energy source of crunchy Ezekiel 4:9 cereal is a great way to start the day off right. Ezekiel 4:9 cereal can be enjoyed as a hot or cold breakfast cereal. Top with fresh fruit for a healthy snack anytime, such as after a workout or in the evening. Hot Cereal Lovers combine Ezekiel 4:9 cereal with a rice milk, soy milk or coconut juice, and heat. Our cereals contain no refined sugar, preservatives, artificial colors or flavors, no shortening and no cholesterol. You can see, taste, and smell the live grain difference of our crunchy cereals. The Original 100% Flourless Complete Protein: Ezekiel 4:9 Sprouted Grain Crunchy Cereal is inspired by the Holy Scripture verse: Take also unto thee wheat and barley and beans and lentils and millet and spelt and put them in one vessel and make bread of it. This biblical cereal is truly the staff of life. The Nutrition Truth: We discovered when these six grains and legumes are sprouted and combined, an amazing thing happens. A complete protein is created that closely parallels the protein found in milk and eggs. In fact, the protein quality is so high, that it is 84.3% as efficient as the highest recognized source of protein, containing all 9 essential amino acids. Plus, there are 18 amino acids present in this unique cereal from all-vegetable sources! Yeast-free. No added oil. No artificial flavors. USDA organic. Certified organic by QAI.

As described in the Holy Scriptures - Take also unto thee wheat and barley and beans and lentils and millet and spelt and put them in one vessel and make bread of it - Ezekiel 4:9. Certified Organic Grains. Did you know? Food For Life Ezekiel 4:9 Sprouted Grain Crunchy Cereals are made from sprouted organic live grains, legumes, and seeds, and contain absolutely no flour. Sprouting is the only way to release all of the vital nutrients stored in whole grains. We add just the right amount of water to healthy, whole, organically grown grains to unlock dormant food energy and maximize nutrition and flavor. Beneficial enzymes are activated which cause the grains to sprout and become a living food. The enzymatic action increases valuable nutrients and also causes a natural change that promotes a more efficient assimilation of protein and carbohydrates. Our exclusive slow baking technique helps preserve valuable nutrients and retain important natural fiber and bran. Your body and taste buds will know the difference. The natural whole grain goodness and energy source of crunchy Ezekiel 4:9 cereal is a great way to start the day off right. Ezekiel 4:9 cereal can be enjoyed as a hot or cold breakfast cereal. Top with fresh fruit for a healthy snack anytime, such as after a workout or in the evening. Hot Cereal Lovers combine Ezekiel 4:9 cereal with a rice milk, soy milk or coconut juice, and heat. Our cereals contain no refined sugar, preservatives, artificial colors or flavors, no shortening and no cholesterol. You can see, taste, and smell the live grain difference.

Plus, there are 18 amino acids present in this unique cereal from all-vegetable sources! Yeast-free. No added oil. No artificial flavors. USDA Organic. Certified Organic by QAI.

Write for a brochure or product list: Bob's Red Mill Natural Foods, Inc. 13521 SE Pheasant Court Milwaukie, Oregon 97222. Dear friends, We would like to share with you the importance of including whole grain foods in your diet. A whole grain includes all three parts of the grain kernel: the bran, endosperm and germ. Whole grains have long been over-generalized as just a good source of dietary fiber, but they also contain important vitamins, minerals, and hundreds of unique phytochemicals. Recent scientific research has discovered that the benefits of eating whole grains come from the synergistic efforts of the fiber, vitamins, minerals and phyto-chemicals - not just the individual components. They all work together to offer health benefits that are greater than the sum of the parts. Exactly how they work together is uncertain, but studies clearly show that including whole grains in your diet may reduce your risk of certain chronic disease. Certain Caners: Scientific evidence suggests that a diet including whole grains reduces the risks for some cancers, especially gastrointestinal cancers. Heart Disease: Antioxidants contained in whole grains may work with fiber and other compounds to reduce your overall risk of heart disease. So for your good health, start eating at least three servings of whole grain foods every day. My Bob's Red Mill 7 Grain Hot Cereal is a delicious way to include them in your diet. It carries my highest endorsement. Come visit us right now at www.bobsredmill.com. To your good health, Bob Moore. Our product line is diverse and extensive.

We Make People Happy: It all started in the small bakery of a natural foods market on Main Street in Glastonbury, Connecticut. I listened to my celiac customers' concerns about the taste of many of the gluten free options available to them, and thought that no one should have to suffer because of a food allergy or other special dietary need. And so my mission became to create products that would make my customers happy. Today, that mission has expanded to not only make our customers happy with great-tasting gluten free products, but spreading a little bit of happiness to everyone we meet and work with. I'd also like to encourage you to think about the things that make you happy, and to do something to make yourself, a family member, a friend or even a complete stranger happy. Now our bakery is bigger, but we still bake in small batches. We hope you love our products as much as we love creating them for you. Thank you! - Michael Smulders, Founder.

Don Franciscos Coffee, Gourmet, All Purpose Grind, Medium Roast, Hawaiian Hazelnut	12 fl oz (340 g)	Since 1870. The flavor of plump hazelnuts complements this blend of exotic coffees to bring you an enchanting cup. Four generations of master roasting. Don Francisco. Each coffee-growing country offers many grades of coffee, some excellent and some not. But a country's reputation is always built on its very best grade. Many brands mix poor-quality coffee beans with good ones to keep costs down. That's why a coffee lover can be so pleased with one cup, and so disappointed with another. We never mix the quality of coffee. We choose the very highest grade of beans from the best coffee-growing countries, and we keep them pure. Then we roast them in a way that brings out their unique flavor, just the way my family has for over 135 years. So if you want coffee that's built the reputation, it's inside. We hope each country's best will give you the pleasure only a great cup of coffee can. - Don Francisco. Sustainability: Don Francisco taught us to respect and honor the land and its people. That principle is in every aspect of our business today. We are committed to improving the way our coffee-growing partners care for their land, and to enriching their communities through education and healthcare programs. Lively Flavors: Don Francisco's has discovered a way to balance the taste of freshly-roasted coffee with the bouquet of lively flavorings. You'll discover that the appetizing aromas of roasted nuts, zesty cinnamon, butterscotch, or creamy vanilla will bring your coffee experience to new heights of satisfaction. 100% Arabica: Of the two main varieties of coffee, Arabica beans brew a more aromatic and flavorful beverage. The great coffees of the world, such as Colombian and Kona, are Arabicas. These more-flavorful beans appear in stores as whole bean, and in high-quality ground coffees.

The love was so strong we finally made it official, calling it Verona after the city that inspires so many. By any name, this is a thing of pure romance.

Don Franciscos Coffee, Gourmet, All-Purpose Grind, Medium, Cinnamon Hazelnut	12 oz (340 g)	The sweet zest of cinnamon sticks and smooth aroma of hazelnuts bring you a most satisfying cup. Four generations of master roasting. Since 1870. Each coffee-growing country offers many grades of coffee, some excellent and some not. But a country's reputation is always built on its very best grade. Many brands mix poor-quality coffee beans with good ones to keep costs down. That's why a coffee lover can be so pleased with one cup, and so disappointed with another. We never mix the quality of coffee. We choose the very highest grade of beans from the best coffee-growing countries, and we keep them pure. Then we roast them in a way that brings out their unique flavor, just the way my family has for over 135 years. So if you want coffee that's built the reputation, it's inside. We hope each country's best will give you the pleasure only a great cup of coffee can. - Don Francisco. Sustainability: Don Francisco taught us to respect and honor the land and its people. That principle is in every aspect of our business today. We are committed to improving the way our coffee-growing partners care for their land, and to enriching their communities through education and healthcare programs. Lively Flavors: Don Francisco's has discovered a way to balance the taste of freshly-roasted coffee with the bouquet of lively flavorings. You'll discover that the appetizing aromas of roasted nuts, zesty cinnamon, butterscotch, or creamy vanilla will bring your coffee experience to new heights of satisfaction. 100% Arabica: Of the two main varieties of coffee, arabica beans brew a more aromatic and flavorful beverage. The great coffees of the world, such as Colombian and Kona, are arabicas. These more-flavorful beans appear in stores as whole bean, and in high-quality ground coffees.

Publix Premium Coffee, Ground, Breakfast Blend	12 oz (340 g)	Publix Premium Breakfast Blend Coffee brews up bright with a nutty flavor for an easy-drinking cup that's the perfect start to your day. Discover all our varieties. publix.com. It could be said that a delicious cup of coffee is an exquisite combination of science and art. Myriad components play a part in the creation of great-tasting coffee, from the geography and climate of its cultivation, to the artistry and skill of blending and brewing it. The two most critical are the beans and the roast. The Arabica coffee beans we use are the world's finest, grown only at certain elevations between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Relatively delicate plants, they require expert nurturing to flourish and produce the delicate fruit that contains the coffee bean. Careful roasting gives coffee its rich, delicious flavor. During the process, which takes only minutes, natural sugars within the coffee beans are released and become caramelized on the beans' surface. The longer the roast, the fuller the flavor of (and, somewhat surprisingly, the less caffeine in) the coffee. You can rejoice in the taste of Publix Premium Ground Coffee, because our Arabica beans have been roasted to perfection. Whichever blend you choose, we guarantee you'll enjoy its marvelous taste cup after cup. Publix Guarantee: We will never knowingly disappoint you. If for some reason your purchase does not give you complete satisfaction, the full purchase price will be cheerfully refunded immediately upon request.Show LessThe Arabica coffee beans we use are the world's finest, grown only at certain elevations between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.

Publix Premium Coffee, Ground, Colombian	12 oz (340 g)	Publix Premium Colombian Coffee brews up rich and lively with subtle fruity notes for a profound coffee experience. Discover all our varieties. publix.com. It could be said that a delicious cup of coffee is an exquisite combination of science and art. Myriad components play a part in the creation of great-tasting coffee, from the geography and climate of its cultivation, to the artistry and skill of blending and brewing it. The two most critical are the beans and the roast. The Arabica coffee beans we use are the world's finest, grown only at certain elevations between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Relatively delicate plants, they require expert nurturing to flourish and produce the delicate fruit that contains the coffee bean. Careful roasting gives coffee its rich, delicious flavor. During the process, which takes only minutes, natural sugars within the coffee beans are released and become caramelized on the beans' surface. The longer the roast, the fuller the flavor of (and, somewhat surprisingly, the less caffeine in) the coffee. You can rejoice in the taste of Publix Premium Ground Coffee, because our Arabica beans have been roasted to perfection. Whichever blend you choose, we guarantee you'll enjoy its marvelous taste cup after cup. Publix Guarantee: We will never knowingly disappoint you. If for some reason your purchase does not give you complete satisfaction, the full purchase price will be cheerfully refunded immediately upon request.Show Lessans we use are the world's finest, grown only at certain elevations between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.

What goes into making a perfect coffee: It might sound simple, but that is precisely our goal: perfect coffee. To us, it's far more than a matter of tasting great.

Don Franciscos Coffee, Gourmet, All Purpose Grind, Medium, Hawaiian Blend	12 oz (340 g)	Since 1870. Kona, Kauai, Molokai, or Maui are blended with Central America's richest coffees to create a distinctive cup. All-purpose grind. Don Francisco. Each coffee-growing country offers many grades of coffee, some excellent and some not. But a country's reputation is always built on its very best grade. Many brands mix poor-quality coffee beans with good ones to keep costs down. That's why a coffee lover can be so pleased with one cup, and so disappointed with another. We never mix the quality of coffee. We choose the very highest grade of beans from the best coffee-growing countries, and we keep them pure. Then we roast them in a way that brings out their unique flavor, just the way my family has for over 135 years. So if you want coffee that's built the reputation, it's inside. We hope each country's best will give you the pleasure only a great cup of coffee can. - Don Francisco. Sustainability: Don Francisco taught us to respect and honor the land and its people. That principle is in every aspect of our business today. We are committed to improving the way our coffee-growing partners care for their land, and to enriching their communities through education and healthcare programs. Volcanic Soil: These coffees are born in rich, volcanic soils, raised in special micro-climates. Branch-ripened and hand-picked. These selections are the best of their regions, and roasted to deliver their unique flavor treasures. One of our most popular and satisfying blends. 100% Arabica: Of the two main varieties of coffee, Arabica beans brew a more aromatic and flavorful beverage. The great coffees of the world, such as Colombian and Kona, are Arabicas. These more-flavorful beans appear in stores as whole bean, and in high-quality ground coffees.

That principle is in every aspect of our business today. We are committed to improving the way our coffee-growing partners care for their land, and to enriching their communities through education and healthcare programs. Volcanic Soil: These coffees are born in rich, volcanic soils, raised in special micro-climates. Branch-ripened and hand-picked. These selections are the best of their regions, and roasted to deliver their unique flavor treasures. One of our most popular and satisfying blends. 100% Arabica: Of the two main varieties of coffee, Arabica beans brew a more aromatic and flavorful beverage. The great coffees of the world, such as Colombian and Kona, are Arabicas. These more-flavorful beans appear in stores as whole bean, and in high-quality ground coffees.
