Osem Matzah, Israeli	16 oz (453 g)	In every generation, one must look upon oneself as if one personally had come out from Egypt. Kosher for Passover and all year round. Regular matzah mehudar. The Story of Exodus: The Egyptian Pharaoh enslaved the Israelites and forced them into hard labor building Egypt. Moses, their leader and a holy man, asked Pharaoh to set his people free, but Pharaoh refused. Even as G-d unleashed nine plagues upon the Egyptians, Pharaoh would not relent. Only after his own son was killed in the tenth plague did Pharaoh agree to free the Israelites, yet he soon changed his mind and sent his army after them. After escaping from the pursuing Egyptians by crossing the Red Sea, the Israelites then wandered the desert for 40 years, during which time Moses conveyed them the Ten Commandments. G-d would not allow the Israelites to enter the land of Israel until a new generation that did not know slavery had come into being. The story of Exodus thus signifies a new beginning, a life slavery, and hope for a new nation. The original drawings on the various Osem Matzah products were created for Osem by two very talented Israeli artists, and they illustrate the important events of the Hagadah: The Red Sea Crossing, the Delivery of the 10 Commandments, the Burning Bush, etc. Enjoy the quality Israeli Matzah in this box and use the illustrations on the boxes (and the stones at the back) to review the Exodus events as you gather with your family at the table throughout the Passover week.

The taste of a memory. In 1925 Aron Streit opened his first matzo bakery. That was on Rivington Street in Manhattan's Lower East Side, a place that would become as famous for its food as for its Yiddish theater. A tasty kugel, a hearty soup, a delicious matzo ball. People who lived there shared more than dreams of a better life in America - they shared their family's treasured recipes. Around the holidays, food was even more important. Just the right potato latkes were needed for Chanukah, the right of matzo on Passover. Streit's was there then and we're here now.

Streits Potato Starch	12 oz (340 g)	Since 1925. Under Soloveichik Rabbinic Supervision since 1957. For more recipes, visit our website at www.streitsmatzos.com. The Taste of a Memory: In 1925 Aron Streit opened his matzo bakery. That was on Rivington Street in Manhattan's Lower East Side, a place that would become as famous for its food as for its Yiddish theater. A tasty kugel, a hearty soup, a delicious matzo ball. People who lived there shared more than dreams of a better life in America - they shared their family's treasured recipes. Around the holidays, food was even more important. Just the right potato latkes were needed for Chanukah, the right kind of matzo on Passover. Streit's was there then and we're here now. We work out of the very same building used by our great-grandfather and we share his vision: to bring you wholesome Jewish food that takes you back to your childhood and connects you with your past.

Alessi Gnocchi, Potato	16 oz (1 lb) 454 g	Italian potato dumplings. The evolution of gnocchi is quite an interesting one. It is believed that gnocchi, which in Italian translates as lumps, were the first type of pasta to be eaten by Italians. Theory has it that bits of a dough made of flour and water were pinched off and shaped with the tines of a fork and then dropped into boiling water. These small, tasty dumplings cooked quickly and their texture allowed sauces to readily adhere. With the introduction of the potato from the New World, Italians exchanged wheat flour for potato flour which resulted in an even lighter, more delicate gnocchi. Taste for yourself whether authentic Alessi Potato Gnocchi confirm the wisdom of the Italians, who we believe made a good idea even better. www.alessifoods.com.Show Less, Italians exchanged wheat flour for potato flour which resulted in an even lighter, more delicate gnocchi.

Cheese from cows not treated with rBST (No significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rBST-treated and non rBST-treated cows). See nutrition information for sodium content. Homegrown. Rabbit of approval. Box tops for education. Meet Bernie! Bernie was Annie's pet Dutch rabbit. When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official rabbit of approval representing the simplicity, care and goodness in all of our products. Dear Friend, My husband Rob and I were the Annie's Consumer Relations and Mail Order team for several years and were accustomed to the phone ringing day and night. If the phone rang at 2:00 am, it might have been a friend or family member, but more likely it was someone calling to order mac & cheese. Annie's original warehouse was an old grain mill without climate control. Rob and I hand-addressed every mail-ordered case, and during the winter months I often used a hair dryer to keep my fingers nimble. We packed our two-door Volkswagen with up to 50 cases, keeping our tiny post office busy. My connection to our consumers deepened with every case sent during those years; a connection, I believe, is the foundation of Annie's. Bye for now, Annie. Support family farms - use organic milk, butter, and yogurt! For even more suggestions, visit us at Annies.com. We partner with people & places we trust to grow the organic wheat to make flour for our macaroni and to produce milk for our cheese + to make your mac & cheese wonderfully wholesome & delicious!

When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official rabbit of approval representing the simplicity, care, and goodness in all of our products. Dear Friend, In our early years, we relied on creativity to get our mac cheese into as many hands as possible. Opportunities came with events such as the Boom Box Parade in Willimantic, Connecticut. As a clever alternative to a marching band, everyone marched with their own boom box volume turned way up. We piled cases of Annie's into my husband's truck and joined the fire trucks, floats, and marchers parading down Main Street. The truck was covered with Annie's magnets, and we tossed them into the crowd. We ran back and forth, handing out boxes of Annie's. Try it, we said, and if you like it, tell a friend. The Boom Box Parade has grown in popularity over the past two decades. And, so has Annie's. A constant for me are the connections I make with our consumers - they are as meaningful now as they were 25 years ago. Bye for now, Annie. For even more suggestions, visit us at Annies.com.

See nutrition information for sodium content. Meet Bernie! Bernie was Annie's pet Dutch rabbit. When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official rabbit of approval representing the simplicity, care, and goodness in all of our products. Dear Friend, My husband Rob and I were the Annie's consumer relations and mail order team for several years and were accustomed to the phone ringing day and night. If the phone rang at 2:00 AM, it might have been a friend or family member, but more likely it was someone calling to order mac & cheese. Annie's original warehouse was an old grain mill without climate control. Rob and I hand-addressed every mail-ordered case, and during the winter months I often used a hair dryer to keep my fingers nimble. We packed our two-door Volkswagen with up to 50 cases, keeping our tiny post office busy. My connection to our consumers deepened with every case sent during those years; a connection, I believe, is the foundation of Annie's. Bye for now, Annie.

Dear Friend, Soon after we met, my husband Rob and I started our small, organic vegetable farm in northeastern Connecticut. We planted half an acre of asparagus on former pasture land and slowly expanded every year. We use no chemical fertilizers, herbicides, or pesticides, instinctively knowing that the health of the soil and water is a priority. We compost, mulch, hoe, weed, and pick off foraging bugs. From the microorganisms in our soil, to the honey bees and butterflies pollinating, to the Purple Martins swooping for insects - all contribute to our organic practices. Working together, we are enhancing our tiny piece of Earth, and that's a beautiful thing. By for now, Annie. Support family farms - use organic milk, butter, and yogurt!

Annies Macaroni & Cheese, Gluten Free, Rice Pasta & Cheddar	6 oz (170 g)	Rabbit of approval. 100% real cheese. Made with goodness! No artificial flavors, synthetic colors or preservatives. A good source of calcium. Cheese from cows not treated with the growth hormone, rBST (No significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rBST-treated and non rBST-treated cows). Meet Bernie! Bernie was Annie's pet Dutch rabbit. When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official rabbit of approval representing the simplicity, care, and goodness in all of our products. Dear Friend, In our early years, we relied on creativity to get our mac & cheese into as many hands as possible. Opportunities came with events such as the boom box parade in Willimantic, Connecticut. As a clever alternative to a marching band, everyone marched with their own boom box volume turned way up. We piled cases of Annie's into my husband's truck and joined the fire trucks, floats, and marchers parading down Main Street. The truck was covered with Annie's magnets, and we tossed them into the crowd. We ran back and forth, handing out boxes of Annie's. Try it, we said, and if you like it, tell a friend. The boom box parade has grown in popularity over the past two decade. And, so has Annie's. A constant for me are the connections I made with our consumers-they are as meaningful now as they were 20 years ago. Bye for now, Annie. We partner with people and places we trust - to make flour for our rice pasta and to produce milk for our cheese + to make your meal wonderfully wholesome & delicious! We also reduce our bunny footprint by using: 100% recycled paperboard. Minimum 35% post-consumer content. Renewable energy credits. We love to hear your feedback!

Dear Friend, My husband Rob and I were the Annie's Consumer Relations and Mail Order team for several years and were accustomed to the phone ringing day and night. If the phone ran at 2:00 am, it might have been a friend or family member, but more likely it was someone calling to order mac cheese. Annie's original warehouse was an old grain mill without climate control. Rob and I hand-addressed every mail-ordered case, and during the winter months I often used a hair dryer to keep my fingers nimble. We packed our two-door Volkswagen with up to 50 cases, keeping our tiny post office busy. My connection to our consumers deepened with every case sent during those years; a connection, I believe, is the foundation of Annie's. Bye for now, Annie.

When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official rabbit of approval representing the simplicity, care, and goodness in all of our products. Dear Friend, My husband Rob and I were the Annie's Consumer Relations and Mail Order team for several years and were accustomed to the phone ringing day and night. If the phone rang at 2:00 AM, it might have been a friend or Tamil member, but more likely it was someone calling to order mac cheese. Annie's original warehouse was an old grain mill without climate control. Rob and I hand-addressed every mail-ordered case, and during the winter months I often used a hair dryer to keep my fingers nimble. We packed our two-door Volkswagen with up to 50 cases, keeping our tiny post office bust. My connection to our consumers deepened with every case sent during those years; a connection, I believe, is the foundation of Annie's. Bye for now. - Annie.

Dear Friend, My husband Rob and I were the Annie's Consumer Relations and Mail Order team for several years and were accustomed to the phone ringing day and night. If the phone rang at 2:00 AM, it might have been a friend or family member, but more likely it was someone calling to order mac & cheese. Annie's original warehouse was an old grain mill without climate control. Rob and I hand-addressed every mail-ordered case, and during the winter months I often used a hair dryer to keep my fingers nimble. We packed our two-door Volkswagen with up to 50 cases, keeping our tiny post office busy. My connection to our consumers deepened with every case sent during those years; a connection, I believe, is the foundation of Annie's. Bye for now, Annie.

Dear Friend, In our early years, we relied on creativity to get our mac & cheese into as many hands as possible.

We piled cases of Annie's into my husband's truck and joined the fire trucks, floats, and marchers parading down Main Street. The truck was covered with Annie's magnets, and we tossed them into the crowd. We ran back and forth, handing out boxes of Annie's. Try it, we said, and if you like it, tell a friend.

Meet Bernie! Bernie was Annie's pet Dutch rabbit. When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official rabbit of approval representing the simplicity, care, and goodness in all of our products. Dear Friend, My husband Rob and I were the Annie's Consumer Relations and Mail Order team for several years and were accustomed to the phone ringing day and night. If the phone rang at 2:00 AM, it might have been a friend or family member, but more likely it was someone calling to order mac & cheese. Annie's original warehouse was an old grain mill without climate control. Rob and I hand-addressed every mail-ordered case, and during the winter months I often used a hair dryer to keep my fingers nimble. We packed our two-door Volkswagen with up to 50 cases, keeping our tiny post office busy. My connection to our consumers deepened with every case sent during those years; a connection, I believe, is the foundation of Annie's. Bye for now, - Annie.

Minute Multi-Grain Medley	4 - 3 oz bags [12 oz (340 g)]	4 pre-portioned bags. Brown rice, red rice, wild rice and quinoa. 100% whole grain. Gluten free. Ready in 10 minutes. Microwaveable. 100% Whole Grain: 43 g or more per serving. Eat 48 g or more of whole grains daily. WholeGrainsCouncil.org. Brown rice, red rice, wild rice and quinoa are gluten-free and cholesterol free foods. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recognize the many nutritional and health benefits of whole grains and recommend that all adults eat at least half their grains as whole grains. The Whole Grain Council recommends eating a daily minimum of 48 grams of whole grains, and at least three servings of whole grains per day. Minute Multi-Grain Medley is 100% whole grain and provides 43 grams per serving, which is almost 90% of the council's daily whole grain recommendation. Whole grains include a variety of grains and each grain provides a different array of nutrients. Eating a variety of whole grains is recommended. Minute Multi-Grain Medley contains a variety of gluten-free whole grains - brown, red and wild rice and quinoa. Whole grain rice is usually brown but can be black, purple, red, or a variety of exotic hues. Health Bonus: Rice is one of the most easily-digested grains - one reason rice cereal is often recommended as a baby's first solid food. This makes rice ideal for those who are gluten-intolerant. Wild rice is not technically rice at all, but the seed of an aquatic grass. It has a strong, hearty flavor that goes well with other grains. Quinoa is a small, light-colored round grain, similar in appearance to sesame seeds. It cooks up light and fluffy. Health Bonus: The protein in quinoa is a complete protein as it contains all 9 essential amino acids. Whole Grains and Nutrients: This chart lists some of the nutrients that whole grains contribute to a healthy diet, and the proportion of the daily value for each. All amounts are based on the FDA standard serving size of 45 grams of dry grain, a little less than 1 cup cooked. Because this product is a mix of grains, some of the nutrients reported in the Nutrition Facts are lower than the amounts in the individual grains. Quinoa: Protein = 10% to 19% of the daily value; Fiber = 10% to 19% of the daily value; Iron = 10% to 19% of the daily value; Phosphorus = 20% or higher of the daily value; Manganese = 20% or higher of the daily value; Thiamin (B1) = 10% to 19% of the daily value; Niacin (B3) = less than 10% of the daily value; Folic acid (B9) = 10% to 19% of the daily value.

Alessi Risotto, with Porcini Mushrooms	8 oz (227 g)	Made with Italian arborio rice. Imported. Italy is Europe's largest producer of rice. The wetlands and cool temperatures of the Lombardi region harbor the ideal conditions for lush rice fields. Resourceful Italians combined rice with the many other items common to their area and developed a dish they lay claim to. It is known as risotto. Rich, creamy risotto is one of Northern Italy's gastronomic delights. The key ingredient in authentic risotto is the short, thick grained rice known as arborio. This rice is the perfect grain for risotto because its texture and cooking properties allow it to retain firmness throughout preparation. Risotto should always be prepared al dente which means tender yet firm to the bite. Alessi risotto Con Funghi Porcini offers a most unique blend of flavor. Funghi Porcini are a particular type of mushroom found throughout the woodlands of Italy beneath pine trees. They are known for their woodsy, aromatic scent and are a wonderful addition to this Italian favorite. This dish is a wonderful accompaniment to most grilled meats, especially lamb.

Vigo Quinoa, Organic	12 oz (340 g)	Imported. Keen-wa. Gluten free and wheat free. All natural. USDA organic. Good source of protein. Organic whole grain. Quinoa (pronounced keen-wa), an ancient food of the Incan civilization, has been referred to throughout history as the Mother seed. Often described as a grain, it is actually the seed of a certain plant in the same family as beets, chard and spinach. It was a staple of the people of the mountainous Andes regions of Bolivia, Peru and Chile for over 5,000 years. Quinoa was so important to the natives they thought of it as a sacred food. When the Spanish conquistadors invaded South America, they destroyed much of the quinoa crops in an effort to defeat and control the indigenous people. The crops were nearly wiped out but have slowly been restored over time. Although once only eaten in South America, its versatility and healthful attributes have made it increasingly popular in the US. Vigo premium quinoa is light, delicate and somewhat nutlike in taste. It cooks up fluffy and adds texture and crunchiness to dishes. Not only high in protein, it includes many essential amino acids. Quinoa is versatile and can easily be used in place of other grains in most recipes including sweetened porridge for breakfast, in salads or in rich stews or soups with meats and vegetables. No wonder it is considered by many to be the perfect food. Since 1947. www.vigofoods.com. Certified organic by QCS. Product of Bolivia or Peru.

Alessi Risotto, with Cheese and Brocollini	6.5 oz (184 g)	Autentico. Premium. Italy is Europe's largest producer of rice. The wetlands and cool temperatures of the Lombardi region harbor the ideal conditions for lush rice fields. Resourceful Italians combined rice with many other items common to their area and developed a dish they lay claim to. It is known as risotto. Rich, creamy risotto is one of Northern Italy's gastronomic delights. The key ingredient in authentic risotto is the short, thick grained rice known as Arborio. This rice is the perfect grain for risotto because its texture and cooking properties allow it to retain firmness throughout preparation. Risotto should always be prepared al dente which means tender yet firm to the bite. Alessi Risotto con Broccolini delivers a spoon full of flavor with every bite. The rich, creamy risotto serves well as a compliment to most meals, especially chicken or pork. The broccoli and cheese mix well with the risotto to create a blend of flavors inspired by Italy itself. Try our other authentic risottos and Buon Appetito! www.alessifoods.com.

Natures Earthly Choice Organic Farro, Italian Pearled	14 oz (397 g)	100% whole grain. Excellent source of fiber. Good source of protein. Good source of iron. USDA organic. Resealable to keep farro fresh. Farro is one of the oldest grains cultivated by humans. Originally discovered in the fertile crescent of the Middle East, our farro is now grown on small family farms in the Umbria region of central Italy. While Farro is a great source of both protein and fiber, what really sets this grain apart is its broad variety of uses. Farro is a softer grain, with a rice-like texture that absorbs the flavor of whatever it is cooked with, making it perfect for almost any meal: a hot breakfast cereal, a hearty soup, a zesty side-dish, and everything in between. Just add your favorite fruit, vegetables and seasoning and enjoy! And because our farro is pearled (which removes the outer husk), it cooks in just minutes. Who says healthy needs to be hard?

This expression certainly applies to our traditional stone grinding mills, which are much like the ones used in early Roman times. It's also true about many of our favorite whole grains, which originated in ancient times. Amaranth, chia seed, farro, Kamut grain, millet, quinoa, sorghum, spelt and teff - they may be lesser-known than familiar grains like wheat and barley, but each one has a story to tell, with histories going back thousands of years and rich cultural traditions from around the globe. Lucky for us, these whole grains aren't just ancient history; they're also tasty, nutritious additions to modern meals. These super grains of the ancient world are wonderfully healthy, and their unique flavors and textures will add a delicious twist to your favorite recipes. They're versatile, too - great for snacks, salads, side dishes, entrees and baked goods. At Bob's Red Mill, we're always exploring the world in search of new whole grain adventures, and we're proud to mill the widest possible diversity of whole grain foods.

Alessi Risotto, alla Milanese	8 oz (227 g)	Made with Italian arborio rice. Milanese style with saffron. Italy is Europe's largest producer of rice. The wetlands and cool temperatures of the Lombardi region harbor the ideal conditions for lush rice fields. Resourceful Italians combined rice with the many other items common to their area and developed a dish they lay claim to. It is known as risotto. Rich, creamy risotto is one of Northern Italy's gastronomic delights. The key ingredient in authentic risotto is the short, thick grained rice known as Arborio. This rice is the perfect grain for risotto because its texture and cooking properties allow it to retain firmness throughout preparation. Risotto should always be prepared al dente which means tender yet firm to the bite. Alessi Risotto alla Milanese is the classic risotto dish of Milan. Arborio rice is coupled with saffron, the word's most expensive spice. This robust, intensely flavored dish is the most highly regarded of all risottos and is usually served with meats cooked in a red or wine sauce.Show Lesse known as Arborio.

Alessi Risotto, with Sun Dried Tomatoes	8 oz (227 g)	Made with Italian Arborio rice. Imported. Italy is Europe's largest producer of rice. The wetlands and cool temperatures of the Lombardi region harbor the ideal conditions for lush rice fields. Resourceful Italians combined rice with the many other items common to their area and developed a dish they lay claim to. It is known as risotto. Rich, creamy risotto is one of Northern Italy's gastronomic delights. The key ingredient in authentic risotto is the short, thick grained rice known as arborio. This rice is the perfect grain for risotto because its texture and cooking properties allow it to retain firmness throughout preparation. Risotto should always be prepared al dente which means tender yet firm to the bite. Alessi Risotto Con Pomodori Secchi is an easy to prepare culinary treat. The sun dried tomatoes used in this product are from the farmlands of sunny Italy. Handpicked while juicy, red and fragrantly ripe they are then split in half, salted and laid out on large wooden flats to dry in the sun. This has been a traditional yet popular dish throughout Northern Italy. This dish is a wonderful accompaniment to most grilled meats, especially chicken.

Bobs Red Mill Grains of Discovery Quinoa, Whole Grain, Organic	26 oz (1 lb 10 oz) 737 g	The traditional grain of the Andes. To your good health - Bob Moore. Gluten free. Circa 2000 BC. An employee-owned company. Bob's Red Mill passport to whole grain adventure. 100% Whole Grain: 46 g or more per serving. Eat 48 g or more of whole grains daily. WholeGrainsCounil.org. USDA Organic. Enjoy quinoa, a nutrient-rich grain that was honored as a sacred crop by the ancient Incas. Quinoa is a good source of iron and high quality protein. Try it in any recipe calling for whole grains. Quinoa, native to South America, is a pseudo-grain - actually a gluten-free seed, but used in cooking like a whole grain. This amazing plant was domesticated thousands of years ago near Lake Titicaca, high on the plateaus of the Andes, and it was a mainstay in the diet of the ancient Incas. Quinoa is delicious on its own and in pilafs, soups and salads. Our quinoa has been thoroughly rinsed and air dried to remove the naturally occurring bitter saponins. Bob's Red Mill products labeled gluten free are batch tested in our quality control laboratory. We use an ELISA gluten assay test to confirm that a product is gluten free. Our product line is diverse and extensive. For information and recipes, visit our website at www.bobsredmill.com. Dear Friends, There's a saying, what once was old is new again. This expression certainly applies to our traditional stone grinding mills, which are much like the ones used in early Roman times. It's also true about many of our favorite whole grains, which originated in ancient times. Amaranth, chia seed, farro, kamut grain, millet, quinoa, sorghum, spelt and teff - they may be lesser-known than familiar grains like wheat and barley, but each one has a story to tell, with histories going back thousands of years and rich cultural traditions from around the globe. Lucky for us, these whole grains aren't just ancient history; they're also tasty, nutritious additions to modern meals. Packed with vitamins, minerals, and protein, these super grains of the ancient world are wonderfully healthy, and their unique flavors and textures will add a delicious twist to your favorite recipes. They're versatile, too - great for snacks, salads, side dishes, entrees and baked goods. At Bob's Red Mill, we're always exploring the world in search of new whole grain adventures, and we're proud to mill the widest possible diversity of whole grain foods. With that in mind, we invite you to join us in discovering these grains of antiquity. To your good health, - Bob Moore. Certified organic by QAI.

Konriko Brown Rice, Wild Pecan	7 oz (198.4 g)	The natural, nutty aroma long-grain brown & wild rice mix with natural pecan flavoring you've loved for over 30 years! Wheat & gluten free. No MSG! Cooks in just 20 minutes! Aromatic brand. My Pledge to You: Wild Pecan Aromatic Brown Rice Mix is a variety of 100% whole grain rice that has a natural nutty aroma and flavor, which reminds me of the pecan trees that grow wild on my farm. Here at the Conrad Rice Mill, we are very proud of this product and our other Konriko brand food products. I invite you to write to me with your comments and to request some of our favorite recipes. Bon Appetit! - Mike Davis, President, Conrad Rice Mill. Konriko - Making your life easier with healthy, gourmet side dishes & seasonings! In the enchanting Acadian countryside of south Louisiana, where much of this nation's rice is grown, there's a small corner of farmland distinctly different from all the rest. Here, in the rich soil of Iberia Parish, a rare variety of long-grain rice is grown that is cultivated nowhere else. Our tale begins years ago, when a young rice miller was experimenting with some rice seed, hoping to develop a grain with a unique flavor that only nature could provide. And he did. As he gently milled his special rice, leaving most of the bran layers intact, the grain released a wonderful aroma. In the kitchen, as he cooked the rice, the air filled with a rich, nutty fragrance. At the table, it had a subtle, nutty taste. This aroma was so reminiscent of the native pecans that grew in the area, that the young miller began calling his new rice wild pecan rice. For over two decades Konriko Wild Pecan Aromatic Rice has been produced exclusively by America's oldest operating rice mill, Conrad Rice Mill of New Iberia, and has become a favorite in many households around the country. From time to time, however, someone would ask us if we ever thought of using brown rice in our product. One day we decided to try it and we were delighted with the result! And, unlike other brown rice mixes, our special, 100% whole grain brown rice cooks up in only half the time of regular brown rice!Show Less.
