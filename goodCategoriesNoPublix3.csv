Microwaveable. 100% Whole Grain: 43 g or more per serving. Eat 48 g or more of whole grains daily. WholeGrainsCouncil.org. Brown rice, red rice, wild rice and quinoa are gluten-free and cholesterol free foods. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recognize the many nutritional and health benefits of whole grains and recommend that all adults eat at least half their grains as whole grains. The Whole Grain Council recommends eating a daily minimum of 48 grams of whole grains, and at least three servings of whole grains per day. Minute Multi-Grain Medley is 100% whole grain and provides 43 grams per serving, which is almost 90% of the council's daily whole grain recommendation. Whole grains include a variety of grains and each grain provides a different array of nutrients. Eating a variety of whole grains is recommended. Minute Multi-Grain Medley contains a variety of gluten-free whole grains - brown, red and wild rice and quinoa. Whole grain rice is usually brown but can be black, purple, red, or a variety of exotic hues. Health Bonus: Rice is one of the most easily-digested grains - one reason rice cereal is often recommended as a baby's first solid food. This makes rice ideal for those who are gluten-intolerant.

10350	Alessi Risotto, with Porcini Mushrooms	8 oz (227 g)	Made with Italian arborio rice. Imported. Italy is Europe's largest producer of rice. The wetlands and cool temperatures of the Lombardi region harbor the ideal conditions for lush rice fields. Resourceful Italians combined rice with the many other items common to their area and developed a dish they lay claim to. It is known as risotto. Rich, creamy risotto is one of Northern Italy's gastronomic delights. The key ingredient in authentic risotto is the short, thick grained rice known as arborio. This rice is the perfect grain for risotto because its texture and cooking properties allow it to retain firmness throughout preparation. Risotto should always be prepared al dente which means tender yet firm to the bite. Alessi risotto Con Funghi Porcini offers a most unique blend of flavor. Funghi Porcini are a particular type of mushroom found throughout the woodlands of Italy beneath pine trees. They are known for their woodsy, aromatic scent and are a wonderful addition to this Italian favorite. This dish is a wonderful accompaniment to most grilled meats, especially lamb.

Quinoa (pronounced keen-wa), an ancient food of the Incan civilization, has been referred to throughout history as the Mother seed. Often described as a grain, it is actually the seed of a certain plant in the same family as beets, chard and spinach. It was a staple of the people of the mountainous Andes regions of Bolivia, Peru and Chile for over 5,000 years. Quinoa was so important to the natives they thought of it as a sacred food. When the Spanish conquistadors invaded South America, they destroyed much of the quinoa crops in an effort to defeat and control the indigenous people. The crops were nearly wiped out but have slowly been restored over time. Although once only eaten in South America, its versatility and healthful attributes have made it increasingly popular in the US. Vigo premium quinoa is light, delicate and somewhat nutlike in taste. It cooks up fluffy and adds texture and crunchiness to dishes. Not only high in protein, it includes many essential amino acids. Quinoa is versatile and can easily be used in place of other grains in most recipes including sweetened porridge for breakfast, in salads or in rich stews or soups with meats and vegetables. No wonder it is considered by many to be the perfect food. Since 1947. www.vigofoods.com. Certified organic by QCS. Product of Bolivia or Peru.

Amaranth, chia seed, farro, Kamut grain, millet, quinoa, sorghum, spelt and teff - they may be lesser-known than familiar grains like wheat and barley, but each one has a story to tell, with histories going back thousands of years and rich cultural traditions from around the globe.

The wetlands and cool temperatures of the Lombardi region harbor the ideal conditions for lush rice fields. Resourceful Italians combined rice with many other items common to their area and developed a dish they lay claim to. It is known as risotto. Rich, creamy risotto is one of Northern Italy's gastronomic delights. The key ingredient in authentic risotto is the short, thick grained rice known as Arborio. This rice is the perfect grain for risotto because its texture and cooking properties allow it to retain firmness throughout preparation. Risotto should always be prepared al dente which means tender yet firm to the bite. Alessi Risotto con Broccolini delivers a spoon full of flavor with every bite. The rich, creamy risotto serves well as a compliment to most meals, especially chicken or pork. The broccoli and cheese mix well with the risotto to create a blend of flavors inspired by Italy itself. Try our other authentic risottos and Buon Appetito! www.alessifoods.com.

Resealable to keep farro fresh. Farro is one of the oldest grains cultivated by humans. Originally discovered in the fertile crescent of the Middle East, our farro is now grown on small family farms in the Umbria region of central Italy. While Farro is a great source of both protein and fiber, what really sets this grain apart is its broad variety of uses. Farro is a softer grain, with a rice-like texture that absorbs the flavor of whatever it is cooked with, making it perfect for almost any meal: a hot breakfast cereal, a hearty soup, a zesty side-dish, and everything in between. Just add your favorite fruit, vegetables and seasoning and enjoy! And because our farro is pearled (which removes the outer husk), it cooks in just minutes. Who says healthy needs to be hard?

Bob's Red Mill: Passport to whole grain adventure. 100% Whole Grain: 51 g or more per serving. Eat 48 g or more of whole grains daily. WholeGrainsCouncil.org. Embark on a journey through antiquity with sorghum, a whole grain that traveled along trade routes from ancient Africa to the Middle East, India and China. Sorghum is versatile, nutritious and gluten-free. An employee-owned company. Sorghum originated in Africa thousands of years ago, and then spread through the Middle East and Asia via ancient trade routes, travelling to the Arabian Peninsula, India and China along the Silk Road. Today sorghum remains a staple food in India and Africa, yet it is still relatively unknown in many parts of the world. The hearty, chewy texture of whole grain sorghum is perfect for pilafs and cold salads. For a healthy high-fiber snack, pop sorghum grain like popcorn. Bob's Red Mill products labeled gluten free are batch tested in our quality control laboratory. We use an ELISA Gluten Assay test to confirm that a product is gluten free. Our product line is diverse and extensive. For information and recipes, visit our website at www.bobsredmill.com. Dear Friends, There's a saying, what once was old is new again. This expression certainly applies to our traditional stone grinding mills, which are much like the ones used in early Roman times. It's also true about many of our favorite whole grains, which originated in ancient times. Amaranth, chia seed, farro, Kamut grain, millet, quinoa, sorghum, spelt and teff - they may be lesser-known than familiar grains like wheat and barley, but each one has a story to tell, with histories going back thousands of years and rich cultural traditions from around the globe. Lucky for us, these whole grains aren't just ancient history; they're also tasty, nutritious additions to modern meals. These super grains of the ancient world are wonderfully healthy, and their unique flavors and textures will add a delicious twist to your favorite recipes. They're versatile, too - great for snacks, salads, side dishes, entrees and baked goods. At Bob's Red Mill, we're always exploring the world in search of new whole grain adventures, and we're proud to mill the widest possible diversity of whole grain foods.

10436	Alessi Risotto, alla Milanese	8 oz (227 g)	Made with Italian arborio rice. Milanese style with saffron. Italy is Europe's largest producer of rice. The wetlands and cool temperatures of the Lombardi region harbor the ideal conditions for lush rice fields. Resourceful Italians combined rice with the many other items common to their area and developed a dish they lay claim to. It is known as risotto. Rich, creamy risotto is one of Northern Italy's gastronomic delights. The key ingredient in authentic risotto is the short, thick grained rice known as Arborio. This rice is the perfect grain for risotto because its texture and cooking properties allow it to retain firmness throughout preparation. Risotto should always be prepared al dente which means tender yet firm to the bite. Alessi Risotto alla Milanese is the classic risotto dish of Milan. Arborio rice is coupled with saffron, the word's most expensive spice. This robust, intensely flavored dish is the most highly regarded of all risottos and is usually served with meats cooked in a red or wine sauce.Show Lesse known as Arborio.

10487	Bobs Red Mill Grains of Discovery Quinoa, Whole Grain, Organic	26 oz (1 lb 10 oz) 737 g	The traditional grain of the Andes. To your good health - Bob Moore. Gluten free. Circa 2000 BC. An employee-owned company. Bob's Red Mill passport to whole grain adventure. 100% Whole Grain: 46 g or more per serving. Eat 48 g or more of whole grains daily. WholeGrainsCounil.org. USDA Organic. Enjoy quinoa, a nutrient-rich grain that was honored as a sacred crop by the ancient Incas. Quinoa is a good source of iron and high quality protein. Try it in any recipe calling for whole grains. Quinoa, native to South America, is a pseudo-grain - actually a gluten-free seed, but used in cooking like a whole grain. This amazing plant was domesticated thousands of years ago near Lake Titicaca, high on the plateaus of the Andes, and it was a mainstay in the diet of the ancient Incas. Quinoa is delicious on its own and in pilafs, soups and salads. Our quinoa has been thoroughly rinsed and air dried to remove the naturally occurring bitter saponins. Bob's Red Mill products labeled gluten free are batch tested in our quality control laboratory. We use an ELISA gluten assay test to confirm that a product is gluten free. Our product line is diverse and extensive. For information and recipes, visit our website at www.bobsredmill.com. Dear Friends, There's a saying, what once was old is new again. This expression certainly applies to our traditional stone grinding mills, which are much like the ones used in early Roman times. It's also true about many of our favorite whole grains, which originated in ancient times. Amaranth, chia seed, farro, kamut grain, millet, quinoa, sorghum, spelt and teff - they may be lesser-known than familiar grains like wheat and barley, but each one has a story to tell, with histories going back thousands of years and rich cultural traditions from around the globe. Lucky for us, these whole grains aren't just ancient history; they're also tasty, nutritious additions to modern meals. Packed with vitamins, minerals, and protein, these super grains of the ancient world are wonderfully healthy, and their unique flavors and textures will add a delicious twist to your favorite recipes. They're versatile, too - great for snacks, salads, side dishes, entrees and baked goods. At Bob's Red Mill, we're always exploring the world in search of new whole grain adventures, and we're proud to mill the widest possible diversity of whole grain foods. With that in mind, we invite you to join us in discovering these grains of antiquity. To your good health, - Bob Moore. Certified organic by QAI.

Cooks in just 20 minutes! Aromatic brand. My Pledge to You: Wild Pecan Aromatic Brown Rice Mix is a variety of 100% whole grain rice that has a natural nutty aroma and flavor, which reminds me of the pecan trees that grow wild on my farm. Here at the Conrad Rice Mill, we are very proud of this product and our other Konriko brand food products. I invite you to write to me with your comments and to request some of our favorite recipes. Bon Appetit! - Mike Davis, President, Conrad Rice Mill. Konriko - Making your life easier with healthy, gourmet side dishes & seasonings! In the enchanting Acadian countryside of south Louisiana, where much of this nation's rice is grown, there's a small corner of farmland distinctly different from all the rest. Here, in the rich soil of Iberia Parish, a rare variety of long-grain rice is grown that is cultivated nowhere else. Our tale begins years ago, when a young rice miller was experimenting with some rice seed, hoping to develop a grain with a unique flavor that only nature could provide. And he did. As he gently milled his special rice, leaving most of the bran layers intact, the grain released a wonderful aroma. In the kitchen, as he cooked the rice, the air filled with a rich, nutty fragrance. At the table, it had a subtle, nutty taste. This aroma was so reminiscent of the native pecans that grew in the area, that the young miller began calling his new rice wild pecan rice. For over two decades Konriko Wild Pecan Aromatic Rice has been produced exclusively by America's oldest operating rice mill, Conrad Rice Mill of New Iberia, and has become a favorite in many households around the country. From time to time, however, someone would ask us if we ever thought of using brown rice in our product. One day we decided to try it and we were delighted with the result! And, unlike other brown rice mixes, our special, 100% whole grain brown rice cooks up in only half the time of regular brown rice!Show Less.

The result is a tangy, salty, sour taste delivered with a full, hearty crunch that people crave. Thank you for buying Cape Cod Potato Chips. We hope you agree they are ridiculously good!

A Pop of Positivity: Back when Dan and I first started popping kettle corn in our Mankato garage, we wanted to teach our kids the value of hard work - and have a little fun along the way. We also wanted a snack we felt good about feeding them (and, ah, the world). Flavorful snacks with real ingredients found in a kitchen, not in a lab (you know, ingredients you don't have to scrunch up your face to say). Snacks packed with energy, not guilt. Snacks that keep the joy in snacking (and snacking and snacking). With bright bags that radiate all the love and fun that went into them from the beginning. After all, isn't that what snacking should be about? We couldn't agree more. Enjoy. - XO, Angie. I'm a little bit salty. I'm a little bit rock 'n' roll.

A Pop of Positivity: Back when Dan and I first started popping kettle corn in our Mankato garage, we wanted to teach our kids the value of hard work - and have a little fun along the way. We also wanted a snack we felt good about feeding them (and, ah, the world). Flavorful snacks with real ingredients found in a kitchen, not in a lab (you know, ingredients you don't have to scrunch up your face to say). Snacks packed with energy, not guilt. Snacks that keep the joy in snacking (and snacking and snacking). With bright bags that radiate all the love and fun that went into them from the beginning. After all, isn't that what snacking should be about? We couldn't agree more. Enjoy. - XO, Angie.

10769	Terra Vegetable Chips, Original	6.8 oz (192 g)	Real vegetable chips. Sea salt. Non GMO. Parsnip. Taro. Sweet potato. Yuca. Batatta. Over 20 years ago two forward thinking New York chefs created Terra Chips. From the first moment, people were hooked on the vibrant flavors and delectable crunch that comes from sourcing unique and diverse root vegetables from a select group of farmers. Today, the intimate process of crafting our chips remains with over 20 different varieties and flavors that are truly distinctive by nature. Taro: (also known as Malanga and Dasheen) The white chip with the characteristic purplish-brown lines. Sweet Potato: (a distinct variety of the Ipomoea Batatas) A glorious late-summer orange. Batata: (Boniato or Cuban sweet potato) Light brown in color, yet darker than the Yuca. Batata has been savored in the Caribbean for centuries. Parsnip: A member of the same family as carrots, fennel, parsley, celery, celeriac and chervil. Yuca: (Cassava) The lightest of color of the Terra Chips, pale yellow-white. Ruby Dipped Vegetables: Perhaps the most dramatic, these Terra Chips are kissed with beet juice, resulting in their distinctive autumn red color. Seed Savers Exchange. Passing on our garden heritage. Terra proudly supports Seed Savers Exchange, a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and proliferation of heirloom fruit and vegetable varieties.

USDA organic. Quality Assurance International certified organic. Unique organic blue stone-ground corn chips. We are proud to bring you Organically Grown Blue Corn Chips, made with some of the finest non-hydrogenated organic oils in the market. These chips are very thin and crispy with the delicious flavor that blue corn brings to your palate. That is the reason the Aztec Indians prayed and glorified the goddess of the corn Chicomecoatl to thank her for providing such a delectable crop. Corn was so important to the Aztecs that she was also known as the goddess of nourishment and they depicted her carrying the sun as a shield. Blue corn has a coarser, sweeter and nuttier taste than other types of corns - delicious! The preparation of nixtamal was a daily task for the housewife, and even now in old Mexico it still occupies up to six hours of a woman's day. The kernels were steeped in lime overnight to loosen the hull, then boiled and skinned, and finally ground to dough by crushing the kernels between a grooved stone roller and a metate (a lava rock stone slab). The nixtamal was usually made into tortillas. Taste these Blue Corn Chips and you will be transported to the Aztecs world, and you too will pray to Chicomecoatl for more.

10813	Terra Vegetable Chips, Real, Exotic Potato	5.5 oz (155 g)	Sea salt. Non GMO. Sweet potato. Yukon gold. Naturally blue potato. Over 20 years ago two forward thinking New York chefs created Terra Chips. From the first moment, people were hooked on the vibrant flavors and delectable crunch that comes from sourcing unique and diverse root vegetables from a select group of farmers. Today, the intimate process of crafting our chips remains with over 20 different varieties and flavors that are truly distinctive by nature. Sweet Potato: (A distinctive variety of the Ipomoea batatas) A glorious late-summer orange. Yukon Gold: Cultivated in Canada and introduced to the world in 1980. Yukon Golds are highly regarded for their beautiful golden color and intense flavor. Naturally Blue Potato: Vibrant bluish-purple in color, with a slightly nutty flavor, they're simply unforgettable. Truly a rhapsody in blue. Ruby Dipped Vegetables: Perhaps the most dramatic, these Terra Chips are kissed with beet juice, resulting in their distinctive autumn red color.

We also wanted a snack we felt good about feeding them (and, ah, the world). Flavorful snacks with real ingredients found in a kitchen, not in a lab (you know, ingredients you don't have to scrunch up your face to say). Snacks packed with energy, not guilt. Snacks that keep the joy in snacking (and snacking and snacking). With bright bags that radiate all the love and fun that went into them from the beginning. After all, isn't that what snacking should be about? We couldn't agree more. Enjoy. - XO, Angie.

Although the authorities have not been able to link these disappearances to any particular individuals, the timing has baffled the neighbors. Reports of numerous crop circles and UFOs have concerned the authorities said Jared Edy! UFO enthusiasts have contributed the sightings to a search by E.T. for Ancient Grains and legumes due to their nutritional benefits. Later reports have found Lentil Chip pieces with unusual jagged teeth marks leading to the same fields. Top Stories. News Flash. Secret Chamber leads to ancient snacking! In a recent archaeological expedition, renowned professor Saj Khan unearthed a passageway that led to the discovery of an unknown pharaoh's tomb. He was startled to see that carved on the walls was an offering of what looks to be a bowl of chips to the king. This was the first time we have seen snacks and immortality depicted together said Khan! Later he found evidence of lentils and more chips hidden in and around servant's quarters. It appears that lentil chips were not only being enjoyed just by royalty, so go ahead and snack like an Egyptian!

11227	Werthers Original Caramel Popcorn, Classic Caramel	6 oz (170.1 g)	Perfectly popped corn wrapped with rich and creamy Werther's Original Caramel. Hand-crafted caramel shoppe taste. The old world recipe. Made with real butter and fresh cream. A long time ago, in the small European village of Werther, candy-maker Gustav Nebel created his finest candy. He used the best ingredients - real butter, fresh cream, white and brown sugars, a pinch of salt and a lot of time. Because they turned out especially well, they were named Werther's Original in honor of the little village. Crafting this smooth, creamy caramel became a family tradition handed down through generations. Now, we've combined this tradition and a snacking favorite to create Werther's Original Caramel Popcorn - the only popcorn with rich and creamy Werther's Original caramel wrapped around perfectly popped corn for a hand-crafted caramel shoppe taste that makes you feel like someone very special.

Buddha Bowl: Our Story: Legend has it that the image of The Laughing Buddha is based on an eccentric joyful monk; an image which has become synonymous with contentment and abundance. According to the legend the Bowl he carried was always filled with precious items, including food, which he shared with all. Our Buddha Bowl is about choosing simple and pure ingredients and sharing in food and love. What sets us apart? We choose organic because organic foods are grown without toxic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers or genetic engineering and provides sustainable farming practices to protect environmental health while improving it. We believe it's better for the planet and better for you. We prefer air-popping for our organic popcorn which makes it lighter and lower in fat and calories. We then sprinkle the kernels with extra virgin coconut oil which is cold pressed without heat or chemicals, keeping the flavors and essential nutrients intact and then dust them with Himalayan pink salt which is derived from ancient sea salt deposits, and is believed to be the purest form of salt available. For sweetness we use unrefined, minimally processed juice of sugar cane. Popcorn is the perfect snack: It's 100% whole grain, is a good source of fiber and this awesomeness contains only 3 g of fat and 110 calories per serving. It's also vegan and gluten free!

The Genesis of Newman's Own Organics and the Pretzel: My father was a wonderful guy, enlightened and philanthropic, with an original perspective on just about everything. But when it came to eating right, he was just lucky that pretzels and popcorn were good for him. So after a year of toiling in the kitchen, I knew I had a pretzel Dad would kill for. Hey Pa, why're you eatin' those bum pretzels? I asked. Bum? What do you know about pretzels? You're just a snot-nosed kid! he barked. Wanna bet? said I. Here's my nickel, said Pa. How about your house, Mr. Highroller? I asked. You're on! Dad shouted with glee. When I whipped out my bag of Newman's Own Organics Pretzels, he know he'd been had. But once he took his first bite, losing the bet meant nothing. The taste of the pretzel lit up a smile like his Oscar did. You win, he said, face down in the pretzel bowl. So, I moved to the big house on the hill while Dad munched his pretzels in the barn. Taste testing here at Newman's Own Organics has shown that our health-conscious friends like these pretzels because of our organic ingredients. Our beer-drinking buddies like them because the pretzels taste great - and that's all they need to know. - Nell Newman. Reg. Penna. Dept. of Agr. (WPH). www.newmansownorganics.com.

Kitchen Basics - an American Original - Dark & Rich - Just Like Homemade: Cooking stock is a central ingredient for soups, sauces and marinades. It is used by many to flavor vegetables, potatoes and rice dishes. For years, making stock from scratch has been the only way health conscious cooks have been able to control and limit ingredients, such as salts and chemicals. But who has the time to make stock from scratch? In 1996, we were the first to introduce ready-to-use cooking stocks. Our stocks are slowly simmered for that dark-rich taste and made naturally from meat, vegetables and herbs, without added or produced MSG, additives or excess salts. We know that it's hard to make healthy food choices with confidence. So, this all-natural, rich-tasting, gluten-free turkey stock is now certified by the American Heart Association which gives shoppers confidence that this product has been screened and verified to meet the American Heart Association's certification criteria to be low in saturated fat and cholesterol for healthy people over age 2. Our Pledge: Guaranteed satisfaction. If you are not happy with any of our products, please call or write. If possible, save box and receipt. See contact information on side panel.

Soups are eaten in almost every corner of the world and over the years, certain soups have become associated with particular countries.

12198	Olivio Vegetable Oil Spread, 60%, Original	15 oz (425 g)	Real butter taste! The goodness of olive oil. Olive oil is an essential part of the Mediterranean diet - a diet that helps people live longer and healthier lives. Olivio's unique formulation with olive oil produces a rich spread with a delicious buttery taste. Come to my kitchen and let's get cooking! - Anna Rossi. Cooking for top chefs on national TV taught me what it takes to be the best. Start with the best ingredients - like golden olive oil - and create unique recipes that enhance the flavors of your favorite foods. And I'm excited to show you how at www.olivio.com! Olivio was born in the vineyards of our family's villa in Tuscany, Italy. To encourage our friends back home to use more olive oil, we blended golden olive oil into a delicious buttery spread. A spread that adds a unique, savory flavor when melted on top of steaming fresh vegetables and smooth creaminess to a hunk of crusty rustic bread. So enjoy life's precious moments, slow down and live well with Olivio. - Ned and Kate.

So simple but so good! This was the perfect chip. Pasta Chips are made with durum wheat semolina flour, Italian herbs and are baked not fried. We've married this Tuscan inspired chip with a different seasonings based on regional Italian favorites, steeped in hundreds of years of Italian culture and living.

Certified organic by Quality Assurance International. 1-(800) 797-5090, M-TH 8-5, FR 8-3 (PST). Web: www.foodforlife.com. Please visit us online for healthy recipes and great serving suggestions. Questions: Are Food For Life sprouted whole grain English muffins gluten-free?

Ez 4:9. We discovered when these six grains and legumes are sprouted and combined, an amazing thing happens. A complete protein is created that closely parallels the protein found in milk and eggs. In fact, the protein quality is so high, that it is 84.3% as efficient as the highest recognized source of protein, containing all 9 essential amino acids. There are 18 amino acids present in these unique english muffins - from all vegetable sources - naturally balanced in nature. The Live Grain Difference! Different from most English muffins today, these unique muffins are made from freshly sprouted live grains and contain absolutely no flour. We believe in sprouting the grains we use in our English muffins because sprouting is the best way to release all of the vital nutrients stored in whole grains (source: Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation). To unlock this dormant food energy, maximized nutrition and flavor, we add just the right amount of water to healthy whole organically grown grains which as already bursting with nutrients. Beneficial enzymes are activated which cause the grains to sprout and become a living food. Our exclusive sprouting process not only significantly increases vitamins but also causes a natural change that allows the protein and carbohydrates to be assimilated by the body more efficiently. And even better still, our exclusive baking process preserves these valuable nutrients and retains the important natural fiber and bran. You can see, taste, and smell the Live Grain Difference, of Food For Life English muffins. As nutritious as they are delicious. Food For Life English muffins are the substance of a meal, not just something that holds a sandwich together. See the difference fresh sprouts really make.

14091	Food for Life Ezekiel 4:9 Sprouted Grain Tortillas, New Mexico Style	6 tortillas [12 oz (340 g)]	The original - 100% flourless. All natural. No preservatives. Certified organic grains. Certified Organic by Quality Assurance International (QAI). Complete protein tortillas. The live grain difference! Ezekiel 4:9 Sprouted Grain Tortillas are inspired by the Holy Scripture verse: Take also unto thee Wheat, and Barley, and Beans, and Lentils, and Millet, and Spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make bread of it - Ezekiel 4:9. We discovered when these six grains and legumes are sprouted and combined, an amazing thing happens. A complete protein is created that closely parallels the protein found in milk and eggs. In fact, the protein quality is so high, that it is 84.3% as efficient as the highest recognized source of protein, containing all 9 essential amino acids. There are 18 amino acids present in these unique tortillas - from all vegetable sources - naturally balance in nature. Ezekiel 4:9 Tortillas, made from freshly sprouted organically grown grains, are naturally flavorful and bursting with nutrients. Rich in protein, vitamins, minerals and natural fiber with no added fat. Try them served warm to release their exceptionally rich, nutty flavor. Truly the Staff of Life. No yeast; No added oil; No baking powder. The Miracle of the Sprouts: Food For Life Tortillas have the live grain difference! Different from most tortillas today, these unique tortillas are made from freshly sprouted live grains and contain absolutely no flour. We believe in sprouting grains because that is the best way to release all of the vital nutrients stored in whole grains (Source: Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation). To unlock this dormant food energy, maximize nutrition and flavor, we add just the right amount of water to healthy whole organically grown grains. Beneficial enzymes are activated which cause the grains to sprout and become a living food. Our exclusive sprouting process not only significantly increases vitamins, but also causes a natural change that allows the protein and carbohydrates to be assimilated by the body more efficiently. And even better still, our exclusive baking process preserves these valuable nutrients and nutrients and retains the important natural fiber and bran. You can see, taste and smell The Live Grain Difference of Food For Life Tortillas, as nutritious as they are delicious. See the difference fresh sprouts really make, and partake of the miracle. Your body and taste buds will know the difference!Show Lessbined, an amazing thing happens. A complete protein is created that closely parallels the protein found in milk and eggs.

As described in the holy scripture verse: Take also unto these wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt and put them in one vessel, and make bread of it. Ez 4:9. Complete protein. 4:9. We discovered when these six grains and legumes are sprouted and combined, an amazing thing happens. A complete protein is created that closely parallels the protein found in milk and eggs. In fact, the protein quality is so high, that it is 84.3% as efficient as the highest recognized source of protein, containing all 9 essential amino acids. There are 18 amino acids present in these unique buns - from all vegetable sources! Ezekiel 4:9 sprouted grain buns are naturally flavorful and bursting with nutrients. Rich in protein, vitamins, minerals and natural fiber with no added fat. Just heat and serve with your burger of choice for a real gourmet taste! Different from most buns today, these unique Buns are made from freshly sprouted Live grains and contain absolutely no flour. We believe in sprouting the grains we use in our buns because sprouting is the best way to release all of the vital nutrients stored in whole grains (Source: Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation). During our exclusive sprouting process, beneficial enzymes are activated which cause the grains to sprout and become a living food. Sprouting increases vitamins in grains and also causes a natural change that promotes more efficient assimilation of protein and carbohydrates by the body. Our slow baking techniques also help to preserve valuable nutrients and important natural fiber. You can see, taste, and smell The live grain difference! of Food for Life Buns. As nutritious as they are delicious, Food For Life Buns are the substance of a meal - not just something that holds a sandwich together. See the difference fresh sprouts really make!

It's part of the starch component of our gluten-free flour blend, and is responsible for giving our waffles a delightfully light texture. No Wheat Flour Here: We opted instead for brown rice flour. Not only is it a naturally gluten-free ingredient, it's also naturally delicious - imparting a slightly nutty flavor to these waffles. publix.com/greenwise. Complete satisfaction or your money back.
