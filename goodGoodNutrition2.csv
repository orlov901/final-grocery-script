Don Franciscos Coffee, Gourmet, All Purpose Grind, Medium Roast, Hawaiian Hazelnut	12 fl oz (340 g)	Since 1870. The flavor of plump hazelnuts complements this blend of exotic coffees to bring you an enchanting cup. Four generations of master roasting. Don Francisco. Each coffee-growing country offers many grades of coffee, some excellent and some not. But a country's reputation is always built on its very best grade. Many brands mix poor-quality coffee beans with good ones to keep costs down. That's why a coffee lover can be so pleased with one cup, and so disappointed with another. We never mix the quality of coffee. We choose the very highest grade of beans from the best coffee-growing countries, and we keep them pure. Then we roast them in a way that brings out their unique flavor, just the way my family has for over 135 years. So if you want coffee that's built the reputation, it's inside. We hope each country's best will give you the pleasure only a great cup of coffee can. - Don Francisco. Sustainability: Don Francisco taught us to respect and honor the land and its people. That principle is in every aspect of our business today. We are committed to improving the way our coffee-growing partners care for their land, and to enriching their communities through education and healthcare programs. Lively Flavors: Don Francisco's has discovered a way to balance the taste of freshly-roasted coffee with the bouquet of lively flavorings. You'll discover that the appetizing aromas of roasted nuts, zesty cinnamon, butterscotch, or creamy vanilla will bring your coffee experience to new heights of satisfaction. 100% Arabica: Of the two main varieties of coffee, Arabica beans brew a more aromatic and flavorful beverage. The great coffees of the world, such as Colombian and Kona, are Arabicas. These more-flavorful beans appear in stores as whole bean, and in high-quality ground coffees.

Don Franciscos Coffee, Gourmet, All-Purpose Grind, Medium, Cinnamon Hazelnut	12 oz (340 g)	The sweet zest of cinnamon sticks and smooth aroma of hazelnuts bring you a most satisfying cup. Four generations of master roasting. Since 1870. Each coffee-growing country offers many grades of coffee, some excellent and some not. But a country's reputation is always built on its very best grade. Many brands mix poor-quality coffee beans with good ones to keep costs down. That's why a coffee lover can be so pleased with one cup, and so disappointed with another. We never mix the quality of coffee. We choose the very highest grade of beans from the best coffee-growing countries, and we keep them pure. Then we roast them in a way that brings out their unique flavor, just the way my family has for over 135 years. So if you want coffee that's built the reputation, it's inside. We hope each country's best will give you the pleasure only a great cup of coffee can. - Don Francisco. Sustainability: Don Francisco taught us to respect and honor the land and its people. That principle is in every aspect of our business today. We are committed to improving the way our coffee-growing partners care for their land, and to enriching their communities through education and healthcare programs. Lively Flavors: Don Francisco's has discovered a way to balance the taste of freshly-roasted coffee with the bouquet of lively flavorings. You'll discover that the appetizing aromas of roasted nuts, zesty cinnamon, butterscotch, or creamy vanilla will bring your coffee experience to new heights of satisfaction. 100% Arabica: Of the two main varieties of coffee, arabica beans brew a more aromatic and flavorful beverage. The great coffees of the world, such as Colombian and Kona, are arabicas. These more-flavorful beans appear in stores as whole bean, and in high-quality ground coffees.

Publix Premium Coffee, Ground, Breakfast Blend	12 oz (340 g)	Publix Premium Breakfast Blend Coffee brews up bright with a nutty flavor for an easy-drinking cup that's the perfect start to your day. Discover all our varieties. publix.com. It could be said that a delicious cup of coffee is an exquisite combination of science and art. Myriad components play a part in the creation of great-tasting coffee, from the geography and climate of its cultivation, to the artistry and skill of blending and brewing it. The two most critical are the beans and the roast. The Arabica coffee beans we use are the world's finest, grown only at certain elevations between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Relatively delicate plants, they require expert nurturing to flourish and produce the delicate fruit that contains the coffee bean. Careful roasting gives coffee its rich, delicious flavor. During the process, which takes only minutes, natural sugars within the coffee beans are released and become caramelized on the beans' surface. The longer the roast, the fuller the flavor of (and, somewhat surprisingly, the less caffeine in) the coffee. You can rejoice in the taste of Publix Premium Ground Coffee, because our Arabica beans have been roasted to perfection. Whichever blend you choose, we guarantee you'll enjoy its marvelous taste cup after cup. Publix Guarantee: We will never knowingly disappoint you. If for some reason your purchase does not give you complete satisfaction, the full purchase price will be cheerfully refunded immediately upon request.Show LessThe Arabica coffee beans we use are the world's finest, grown only at certain elevations between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.

Publix Premium Coffee, Ground, Colombian	12 oz (340 g)	Publix Premium Colombian Coffee brews up rich and lively with subtle fruity notes for a profound coffee experience. Discover all our varieties. publix.com. It could be said that a delicious cup of coffee is an exquisite combination of science and art. Myriad components play a part in the creation of great-tasting coffee, from the geography and climate of its cultivation, to the artistry and skill of blending and brewing it. The two most critical are the beans and the roast. The Arabica coffee beans we use are the world's finest, grown only at certain elevations between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. Relatively delicate plants, they require expert nurturing to flourish and produce the delicate fruit that contains the coffee bean. Careful roasting gives coffee its rich, delicious flavor. During the process, which takes only minutes, natural sugars within the coffee beans are released and become caramelized on the beans' surface. The longer the roast, the fuller the flavor of (and, somewhat surprisingly, the less caffeine in) the coffee. You can rejoice in the taste of Publix Premium Ground Coffee, because our Arabica beans have been roasted to perfection. Whichever blend you choose, we guarantee you'll enjoy its marvelous taste cup after cup. Publix Guarantee: We will never knowingly disappoint you. If for some reason your purchase does not give you complete satisfaction, the full purchase price will be cheerfully refunded immediately upon request.Show Lessans we use are the world's finest, grown only at certain elevations between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.

Each coffee-growing country offers many grades of coffee, some excellent and some not. But a country's reputation is always built on its very best grade. Many brands mix poor-quality coffee beans with good ones to keep costs down. That's why a coffee lover can be so pleased with one cup, and so disappointed with another. We never mix the quality of coffee. We choose the very highest grade of beans from the best coffee-growing countries, and we keep them pure. Then we roast them in a way that brings out their unique flavor, just the way my family has for over 135 years. So if you want coffee that's built the reputation, it's inside. We hope each country's best will give you the pleasure only a great cup of coffee can. - Don Francisco. Sustainability: Don Francisco taught us to respect and honor the land and its people. That principle is in every aspect of our business today. We are committed to improving the way our coffee-growing partners care for their land, and to enriching their communities through education and healthcare programs.

These selections are the best of their regions, and roasted to deliver their unique flavor treasures.

Family tea blenders since 1945. Refreshing peppermint - pure & simple. All natural. Because mama moved the pony stable. In 1945, Ruth Bigelow was trying to establish a market for her new product, Constant Comment Tea. This was no easy task. One evening, Ruth was sharing her discouragement when her sister said - Remember-Mama moved the pony stable. As a child, Ruth's family had a pony named Bottoms, who lived in a sturdy stable outside of the Bigelow's home. When her father announced one day that the family was moving to the other side of Providence, the children lamented that Bottoms would never be happy without his stable. Though she knew it would be a great deal of work, finally, Ruth's mother said, The stable will come. The move commenced and they all paraded across Providence. It took four rented horses and six hired workmen to move the stable while Bottoms trotted behind them. Well-wishers, advice-givers and hecklers followed. On the Bigelow's first night in a strange new house in Providence, Bottoms had his familiar stable. As Ruth relived these scenes, the significance of her sister's comment was clear: if she wanted to do something badly enough she could. Whenever Ruth was feeling defeated, she would remind herself, Mama moved the pony stable. This always gave her the courage and ingenuity to carry on. - The Bigelow family. Unlock the freshness.

Bigelow Black Tea, Classic, Plantation Mint, Bags	20 tea bags [1.18 oz (33 g)]	Fresh and flavorful tea blended with natural spearmint leaves. All natural. Blended with 100% American grown spearmint. Tea bags individually wrapped in foil pouches. Freshness stays in. Air and moisture stay out. America's classic. Family tea blenders since 1945. Whose idea was this anyway? I knew my mother-in-law (Ruth) was a peppermint fan. But I loved spearmint. Every time I would mention spearmint to Ruth she showed no interest. So I decided to take matters into my own hands. My husband David and I went behind closed doors and started experimenting. We wanted a smooth flavorful premium tea to partner with a subtle spearmint flavor. We tried tea after tea to find the perfect combination. Then we set out to find a spearmint grown in America. We tried several spearmints and fell in love with one from a farm out west. Once we created the perfect blend we had to figure out how to share with Ruth our new invention. To be honest, we were nervous. That is when David came up with the perfect plan. So, on Mother's Day that year we were celebrating with Ruth and gave her a gift. Yes the very first box of Plantation Mint!!! She gave us a funny look and then decided to try it - she loved it! All these years later we think back to that day and smile. We hope our tea delights you. - Eunice J Bigelow.

She would personally select and then wrap the perfect gift for each and every employee. Ruth would hand deliver the gifts and extend her gratitude to all for their hard work and dedication to her little tea company. This tradition would continue on as our company grew with my parents selecting different gifts for me and my sister Lori to hand out to each employee. Our mother would dress us in matching outfits that she had hand sewn. I was so excited to be a part of this ritual. With each delivery I insisted on hugging and kissing every employee! As the company continues to grow we have found new ways to honor this tradition. Gifts are still given out, but it is now the children and grandchildren of our employees that are the recipients at our annual North Pole Party. For three generations giving smiles and thanks to our employees and their families has become a Bigelow holiday tradition. We hope our tea delights you.

Try it with milk and sugar for a true chai experience. - Charlie Baden, Celestial Seasonings Blendmaster. Gluten free. Our Natural Heritage: The story of Celestial Seasonings starts back in 1969. We started out picking fresh herbs from the fields and forests of the Rocky Mountains and carefully blending them to create uniquely delicious teas. Today, we offer more than 100 different varieties made with no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives - just the very best herbs, teas, spices and botanicals, always blended with care. Variety's the very spice of life that gives it all its flavor. - William Cowper.

In 1955, Bigelow Tea moved from New York to Connecticut. Soon afterwards, back-to-back hurricanes hit! Connecticut rivers, including the Norwalk River, where the new factory resides, rose up over 35 feet, moving over 50 miles an hour. Ruth and David Bigelow worried desperately about their fledging 10 year old business. When they finally reached the factory, they saw their own version of the Connecticut Tea Party. The building was flooded and all of their tea had washed down the river. Although devastated, Ruth (in her 60's) and David (in his late 70's), were determined not to give up their dream. Turning to an employee, Ruth asked How long till we can get back in business? It took tremendous effort to get everything in order again. However, with the help of their creditors who extended them whatever they needed, the Bigelows were back in business in just a few months. Their tenacity is the foundation of what our company is built on. Our family learned two lessons that we still adhere to: always pay your bills on time, and when you get knocked down, just get right back up! - The Bigelow family. Unlock the freshness.

Son don't tell your mother - Back in 1945, when the Bigelow Tea company first started, Ruth Bigelow and the family could only afford a single-color label for her tea. To help spruce up the package, David Jr. and David Sr. would sit together each night, hand-painting the two ladies on the original label. Each morning, they would put the tea into the family station wagon and sell it store by store. One night, David Sr. turned to David Jr. and said Son, don't tell your mother, but I don't think this company is ever going anywhere. Almost 70 years later, David Jr. still smiles at the memory, and is grateful that his father was mistaken. Today, Bigelow Tea is the specialty tea leader in the US.

In Delaware, sometime in the 1600's, early colonists created a very special tea made by blending grated orange peel and ground sweet spice. The mixture would be put into stone crocks and stored in cold cellars. Ruth was intrigued. She thought this might just be the kind of tea with which to launch a new tea company - a dream she'd had for many years. There was just one problem: this story had given her an idea, but no recorded recipe. Undaunted, Ruth disappeared into her kitchen and began sperimenting (a favorite word of hers). After weeks of trial and error, she emerged with her version of this early Colonial creation. And so Constant Comment, our company's very first tea, was born. - The Bigelow Family.

Sometime in 1942 or '43, my mom and dad decided they wanted to start a tea business. At the time, we lived in a small apartment in Manhattan. They felt strongly that, for the company to be a success, they needed a home where they could begin. Searching the local streets, they found a brownstone, just off of Second Avenue, which was in terrible disrepair. Optimistic, they bought it with the last of their life savings, and replastered and repainted it themselves. It was in this home in 1945, where my mom and dad opened the doors to the new Bigelow Tea Company. Little could they have imagined that their dream would one day grow to be America's number one specialty tea company! - David Bigelow. Unlock the freshness - Here's the key.

Bigelow Black Tea, Spiced Chai, Tea Bags	20 bags [1.73 oz (49 g)]	The perfect balance of bold rich black tea and exotic spices. America's classic. Family tea blenders since 1945. All natural. Tea bags individually wrapped in foil pouches. Fresh stays in. Air and moisture stay out. Son don't tell your mother - Back in 1945, when the Bigelow Tea company first started, Ruth Bigelow and the family could only afford a single-color label for her tea. To, help spruce up the package, David Jr. and David Sr. would sit together each night, hand-painting the two ladies on the original label. Each morning, they would put the tea into the family station wagon and sell it store by store. One night, David Sr. turned to David Jr. and said Son, don't tell your mother, but I don't think this company is ever going anywhere. Almost 70 years later, David Jr. still smiles at the memory, and is grateful that his father was mistaken. Today, Bigelow Tea is the specialty tea leader in the US. Those hand painted labels must have been pretty darn effective! - The Bigelow Family. Caff-O-Meter: Content Per Serving: Black Tea: 30-60 mg.

Sometime in 1942 or '43, my mom and dad decided they wanted to start a tea business. At the time, we lived in a small apartment in Manhattan. They felt strongly that, for the company to be a success, they needed a home where they could begin. Searching the local streets, they found a brownstone, just off of Second Avenue, which was in terrible disrepair. Optimistic, they bought it with the last of their life savings, and replastered and repainted it themselves. It was in this home in 1945, where my mom and dad opened the doors to the new Bigelow Tea Company. Little could they have imagined that their dream would one day grow to be America's No. 1 specialty tea company! - David Bigelow.

A full bodied rich smooth tea perfect any time of day. All natural. America's classic. Family tea blenders since 1945. Thank goodness for that little jar - When Ruth Campbell Bigelow started Bigelow Tea in 1945, the going was tough. She had created a wonderful tea, Constant Comment, but now had to try to sell it, one store at a time. One day, she visited a store that had begun to successfully sell her tea. The shopkeeper shared with her that he had been opening up a container to allow his consumers to enjoy the tea's amazing aroma. One whiff and they were sold! he said. Ruth immediately started including in each case an extra little jar of Constant Comment labeled open and whiff. Shops across the country placed this whiffing jar by their cash registers. This would prove to be a defining moment that helped grow our family's tea company into the success it is today. Thank goodness for that little jar! - The Bigelow family. Unlock the Freshness - Here's the Key: We use a special foil pouch to protect your tea from any air, moisture and surrounding aromas.

Blend of chamomile & mint to calm & soothe. All natural. America's classic. Family tea blenders since 1945. The Connecticut Tea Party: In 1955, Bigelow Tea moved from New York to Connecticut. Soon afterwards, back-to-back hurricanes hit! Connecticut rivers, including the Norwalk River, where the new factory resided, rose up over 35 feet, moving over 50 miles an hour. Ruth and David Bigelow worried desperately about their fledging 10 year old business. When they finally reached the factory, they saw their own version of the Connecticut Tea Party. The building was flooded and all of their tea had washed down the river. Although devastated, Ruth (in her 60's) and David (in his late 70's), were determined not to give up their dream. Turning to an employee, Ruth asked How long till we can get back in business? It took tremendous effort to get everything in order again. However, with the help of their creditors who extended them whatever they needed, the Bigelows were back in business in just a few months.

Buds Best Cookies Cookies, Chocolate Chip, Bite Size	6 oz (170 g)	Lots of real chocolate chips! Little cookie. Big taste. Cookies are in my blood. As a boy of 12 years old, working in my aunt's bakery, I knew that someday I wanted to own my own cookie factory. I've now been in the cookie business for more than forty years. My vision and dream of building the most modern cookie plant in the world came true in 1991. Of course, I've seen a lot of changes over the years - from selling cookies out of a jar for a penny each, to producing over a million cookies per hour. We even offer tours through the plant on our Cookie Train, so you can see for yourself how Bud's Best Cookies are made. But, besides their delicious taste, perhaps one of the greatest things about Bud's Best Cookies is they're bite-sized! That means they're perfect for kids of all ages. Because of our commitment to give our customers the highest quality cookies at the lowest possible price, you have my word - Bud's Best is the best! - Bud Carson.

Buds Best Cookies Cookies, Lemon Cremes, Bite Size	6 oz (170 g)	Little cookie. Big taste. Cookies are in my blood. As a boy of 12 years old, working in my aunt's bakery, I knew that someday I wanted to own my own cookie factory. I've now been in the cookie business for more than forty years. My vision and dream of building the most modern cookie plant in the world came true in 1991. Of course, I've seen a lot of changes over the years - from selling cookies out of a jar for a penny each, to producing over a million cookies per hour. We even offer tours through the plant on our Cookie Train, so you can see for yourself how Bud's Best Cookies are made. But, besides their delicious taste, perhaps one of the greatest things about Bud's Best Cookies is they're bite-sized! That means they're perfect for kids of all ages. Because of our commitment to give our customers the highest quality cookies at the lowest possible price, you have my word: Bud's Best is the best! - Bud Carson.

Alessi Biscotti Savoiardi Lady Fingers	7 oz (200 g)	Perfect for tiramisu. Savoiardi, commonly known as Lady Fingers, are delightful and delicately light cookies from Italy that have been enjoyed by Italians for generations. Eaten as a snack alongside a glass of milk, children love their simple goodness. Adults too enjoy nibbling on them between sips of espresso or cappuccino. The Italians have invented wonderous desserts using them in creations like Tiramisu. Tiramisu is an Italian delight that has of late become a most fashionable dessert. Its origins have been traced back to Siena where it had been called Zuppa Del Duca or The Duke's Soup. The dessert became very popular in Florence in the nineteenth century where the English people who lived in the town renamed it Zuppa Inglese or English Soup. The dessert has several variations and has always enjoyed great popularity over the years regardless of the name. Made with mascarpone cheese, delicate lady fingers and laced with strong espresso coffee, Tiramisu literally translates to pick me up which refers to the inevitable energizing boost this dessert will provide. www.alessifoods.com.

Buds Best Cookies Cookies, Pecan Supremes, Bite Size	6 oz (170 g)	Little cookie. Big taste. Cookies are in my blood. As a boy of 12 years old, working in my aunt's bakery, I knew that someday I wanted to own my own cookie factory. I've now been in the cookie business for more than forty years. My vision and dream of building the most modern cookie plant in the world came true in 1991. Of course, I've seen a lot of changes over the years - from selling cookies out of a jar for a penny each, to producing over a million cookies per hour. We even offer tours through the plant on our Cookie Train, so you can see for yourself how Bud's Best Cookies are made. But, besides their delicious taste, perhaps one of the greatest things about Bud's Best Cookies is they're bite-sized! That means they're perfect for kids of all ages. Because of our commitment to give our customers the highest quality cookies at the lowest possible price, you have my word: Bud's Best is the best! - Bud Carson.

Buds Best Cookies Cookies, Ginger Snaps, Old Fashioned	6 oz (170 g)	Cookies are in my blood. As a boy of 12 years old, working in my aunt's bakery, I knew that someday I wanted to own my own cookie factory. I've now been in the cookie business for more than fifty-five years. My vision and dream of building the most modern cookie plant in the world came true in 1991. Of course, I've seen a lot of changes over the years - from selling cookies out of a jar for a penny each, to producing over a million cookies per hour. We even offer tours through the plant on our Cookie Train, so you can see for yourself how Bud's Best Cookies are made. But, besides their delicious taste, perhaps one of the greatest things about Bud's Best Cookies is they're bite-sized! That means they're perfect for kids of all ages.

Buds Best Cookies Cookies, Chocolate Peanut Butter, Bite Size	6 oz (170 g)	Rich chocolate cookies in real peanut butter filling. Little cookie. Big taste. Cookies are in my blood. As a boy of 12 years old, working in my aunt's bakery, I knew that someday I wanted to own my own cookie factory. I've now been in the cookie business for more than forty years. My vision and dream of building the most modern cookie plant in the world came true in 1991. Of course, I've seen a lot of changes over the years - from selling cookies out of a jar for a penny each, to producing over a million cookies per hour. We even offer tours through the plant on our Cookie Train, so you can see for yourself how Bud's Best Cookies are made. But, besides their delicious taste, perhaps one of the greatest things about Bud's Best Cookies is they're bite-sized! That means they're perfect for kids of all ages. Because of our commitment to give our customers the highest quality cookies at the lowest possible price, you have my word: Bud's Best is the best! - Bud Carson.

Buds Best Cookies Cookies, Oatmeal, Bite Size	6 oz (170 g)	Made with California raisins. Little cookie. Big taste. Cookies are in my blood. As a boy of 12 years old, working in my aunt's bakery, I knew that someday I wanted to own my own cookie factory. I've now been in the cookie business for more than forty years. My vision and dream of building the most modern cookie plant in the world came true in 1991. Of course, I've seen a lot of changes over the years - from selling cookies out of a jar for a penny each, to producing over a million cookies per hour. We even offer tours through the plant on our Cookie Train, so you can see for yourself how Bud's Best Cookies are made. But, besides their delicious taste, perhaps one of the greatest things about Bud's Best Cookies is they're bite-sized! That means they're perfect for kids of all ages.

Annas Swedish Thins, Almond	5.25 oz (150 g)	Sweden's most loved pepparkaka! Since 1929. By appointment to HM the King of Sweden. 0 g trans fat per serving. Some things you just don't change. A lot has happened since Anna Karlsson baked her very first Swedish Thin in her little backstreet bakery in downtown Stockholm, Sweden. Today her Swedish Thins, or pepparkakor in Swedish, are known all over the world. But the recipe Anna used back then hasn't changed one bit. It is still her wonderful mixture of ingredients and flavors. They are still carefully crafted, always using traditional baking trays which gives the Swedish Things their delicate crispness. Perhaps that's why Annas are Sweden's most loved pepparkaka - and have been since 1929.

Buds Best Cookies Coconut Bars, Bite Size	6 oz (170 g)	Little cookie. Big taste. Cookies are in my blood. As a boy of 12 years old, working in my aunt's bakery, I knew that someday I wanted to own my own cookie factory. I've now been in the cookie business for more than forty years. My vision and dream of building the most modern cookie plant in the world came true in 1991. Of course, I've seen a lot of changes over the years - from selling cookies out of a jar for a penny each, to producing over a million cookies per hour. We even offer tours through the plant on our Cookie Train, so you can see for yourself how Bud's Best Cookies are made. But, besides their delicious taste, perhaps one of the greatest things about Bud's Best Cookies is they're bite-sized! That means they're perfect for kids of all ages.

Newmans Own Organics The Second Generation Cookies, Fig Newmans	10 oz (283 g)	Fruit filled cookies made with organic figs. Wheat free. Dairy free. Not a gluten-free product. A Figurative Theory: I think most people know about Adam and Eve's blunder in the garden, but my Pop has developed his own theory. I was in the middle of a peaceful breakfast when Pop bounded up the stairs with a sixty pound crate of ancient scrolls, talking to himself. It wasn't the apple, it was the figs, the figs! I stayed motionless hoping he'd wander off and talk to one of the dogs, when his hand reached out to stop me from eating my oatmeal. Nellie, these scrolls confirm my theory. When Adam and Eve used the fig leaves to cover up their own embarrassment and tossed the precious figs in the dirt, their act in the garden was cancelled. With one hand over my teacup and the other shaking my oatmeal spoon, he concluded his biblical theory, the apple incident, as far as I am concerned, was nothing compared to their wanton waste of the figs. This is why my Pop reveres the fig and I like to eat breakfast in my room. For my Pop's sake, I hope you , too, will revel in the divine quality of our Fig Newmans. Sincerely, Nell Newman.

Buds Best Cookies Cookies, Sandwich, Caco Chocolate, Bite Size	6 oz (170 g)	Little cookie. Big taste. Cookies are in my blood. As a boy of 12 years old, working in my aunt's bakery, I knew that someday I wanted to own my own cookie factory. I've now been in the cookie business for more than forty years. My vision and dream of building the most modern cookie plant in the world came true in 1991. Of course, I've seen a lot of changes over the years - from selling cookies out of a jar for a penny each, to producing over a million cookies per hour. We even offer tours through the plant on our Cookie Train, so you can see for yourself how Bud's Best Cookies are made. But, besides their delicious taste, perhaps one of the greatest things about Bud's Best Cookies is they're bite-sized! That means they're perfect for kids of all ages. Because of our commitment to give our customers the highest quality cookies at the lowest possible price, you have my word: Bud's Best is the best! - Bud Carson.

Goodie Girl Cookies, Oatmeal Raisin	6 oz (170 g)	Just the right amount of wrong. Naturally gluten-free. Certified gluten-free. Somewhere between my decade-long career in punk rock PR, a stint as a fashion model, and raising three kids, I decided that my true talent was the creative mastery of the perfect dose of sugar! So I traded in my cool career to haul thousands of pounds of rice flour to the mixer! I took the best version of a classic cookie and carefully rebuilt it to taste even better than the original by trading the most harmful and punishing ingredients such as hydrogenated fats and preservatives [even gluten!], with better-for-us ingredients. You can make a better tasting cookie without the junk. And trust me, when you gotta have something sweet, a Goodie Girl cookie is Just the right amount of wrong!

Newmans Own Organics The Second Generation Cookies, Fig Newmans	10 oz (283 g)	Fruit filled cookies made with organic figs. Low fat. Nell Newman. Pa Newman. A figurative theory. I think most people know about Adam and Eve's blunder in the garden, but my pop has developed his own theory. I was in the middle of a peaceful breakfast when pop bounded up the stairs with a sixty pound crate of ancient scrolls, talking to himself. It wasn't the apple, it was the figs, the figs! I stayed motionless hoping he'd wander off and talk to one of the dogs, when his hand reached out to stop me from eating my oatmeal. Nellie, these scrolls confirm my theory. When Adam and Eve used the fig leaves to cover their own embarrassment and tossed the precious figs in the dirt, their act in the garden was cancelled. With one hand over my teacup and the other shaking my oatmeal spoon, he concluded his biblical theory, The apple incident, as far as I am concerned, was nothing compared to their wanton waste of the figs. This is why my pop reveres the fig and I like to eat breakfast in my room. For my pop's sake, I hope you, too, will revel in the divine quality of our Fig Newmans - Sincerely, Nell Newman. PS - The enjoyment of our Fig Newmans doesn't require an allegiance to my pop's theory. Certified organic by Oregon Tilth. Cookies made in USA.Show Lessop me from eating my oatmeal.

After weeks of researching the best of organic, gluten-free, kosher and non-GMO flours, nuts, fruits, dark chocolates, eggs and butter, my first winner was born - Chocolate Chip Love - an insanely delicious, gluten-free twist on a classic chocolate chip cookie. My boys and husband raved over them. And so, ginnybakes was born! Today, my first batch of cookies has grown into a line of gluten-free, organic or all natural, kosher, fresh baked cookies, biscottis, bars and bake mixes for everyone to enjoy. I am proud to say ginnybakes are free of preservatives, chemicals and refined sugars. Always looking for ways to enhance and improve fresh baked goods, I will continue to expand our vegan line, while also being conscious of the imminent importance of non-GMO products. I offer these from my heart with love and passion. XO Ginny. Paperboard packaging recyclable. SFI Certified sourcing. www.sfiprogram.org. Less is more. We removed the chocolate chips and the nuts but kept all the golden organic and crisp goodness of our classic gluten-free cookie! Simple and yet oh so yummy! Indulge organically with ginnybakes!

Sushi Chef Nori	5 sheets [0.45 oz (13 g)]	Toasted seaweed sheets. Nori is a sea vegetable, which is cultivated in screened salt water inlet. Once harvested, it is chopped, rolled and dried in the sun and then toasted into crisp sheets. Sushi Chef Nori is especially delicate and flavorful. Its thickness makes it less likely to break when rolled. The flavor, aroma and crispness of Nori is enhanced by quickly passing the shiny side of the sheet over a flame just before use. Nori sheets are wrapped around sushi rice and fillings to form rolled sushi. When cut into strips, Nori is used to secure finger rolls or to add flavor and color to scattered sushi. Crumbled Nori is an attractive garnish for salads or rice. Product of China.Show Lessled sushi.

People who lived there shared more than dreams of a better life in America - they shared their family's treasured recipes. Around the holidays, food was even more important. Just the right potato latkes were needed for Chanukah, the right kind of matzo on Passover. Streit's was there then and we're here now. We work out of the very same building used by our great-grandfather and we share his vision: to bring you wholesome Jewish food that takes you back to your childhood and connects you with your past.

Osem Matzah, Israeli	16 oz (453 g)	In every generation, one must look upon oneself as if one personally had come out from Egypt. Kosher for Passover and all year round. Regular matzah mehudar. The Story of Exodus: The Egyptian Pharaoh enslaved the Israelites and forced them into hard labor building Egypt. Moses, their leader and a holy man, asked Pharaoh to set his people free, but Pharaoh refused. Even as G-d unleashed nine plagues upon the Egyptians, Pharaoh would not relent. Only after his own son was killed in the tenth plague did Pharaoh agree to free the Israelites, yet he soon changed his mind and sent his army after them. After escaping from the pursuing Egyptians by crossing the Red Sea, the Israelites then wandered the desert for 40 years, during which time Moses conveyed them the Ten Commandments. G-d would not allow the Israelites to enter the land of Israel until a new generation that did not know slavery had come into being. The story of Exodus thus signifies a new beginning, a life slavery, and hope for a new nation. The original drawings on the various Osem Matzah products were created for Osem by two very talented Israeli artists, and they illustrate the important events of the Hagadah: The Red Sea Crossing, the Delivery of the 10 Commandments, the Burning Bush, etc. Enjoy the quality Israeli Matzah in this box and use the illustrations on the boxes (and the stones at the back) to review the Exodus events as you gather with your family at the table throughout the Passover week.

Alessi Gnocchi, Potato	16 oz (1 lb) 454 g	Italian potato dumplings. The evolution of gnocchi is quite an interesting one. It is believed that gnocchi, which in Italian translates as lumps, were the first type of pasta to be eaten by Italians. Theory has it that bits of a dough made of flour and water were pinched off and shaped with the tines of a fork and then dropped into boiling water. These small, tasty dumplings cooked quickly and their texture allowed sauces to readily adhere. With the introduction of the potato from the New World, Italians exchanged wheat flour for potato flour which resulted in an even lighter, more delicate gnocchi. Taste for yourself whether authentic Alessi Potato Gnocchi confirm the wisdom of the Italians, who we believe made a good idea even better. www.alessifoods.com.Show Less, Italians exchanged wheat flour for potato flour which resulted in an even lighter, more delicate gnocchi.

Cheese from cows not treated with rBST (No significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rBST-treated and non rBST-treated cows). See nutrition information for sodium content. Homegrown. Rabbit of approval. Box tops for education. Meet Bernie! Bernie was Annie's pet Dutch rabbit. When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official rabbit of approval representing the simplicity, care and goodness in all of our products. Dear Friend, My husband Rob and I were the Annie's Consumer Relations and Mail Order team for several years and were accustomed to the phone ringing day and night. If the phone rang at 2:00 am, it might have been a friend or family member, but more likely it was someone calling to order mac & cheese. Annie's original warehouse was an old grain mill without climate control. Rob and I hand-addressed every mail-ordered case, and during the winter months I often used a hair dryer to keep my fingers nimble. We packed our two-door Volkswagen with up to 50 cases, keeping our tiny post office busy. My connection to our consumers deepened with every case sent during those years; a connection, I believe, is the foundation of Annie's. Bye for now, Annie.

When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official rabbit of approval representing the simplicity, care, and goodness in all of our products. Dear Friend, In our early years, we relied on creativity to get our mac cheese into as many hands as possible. Opportunities came with events such as the Boom Box Parade in Willimantic, Connecticut. As a clever alternative to a marching band, everyone marched with their own boom box volume turned way up. We piled cases of Annie's into my husband's truck and joined the fire trucks, floats, and marchers parading down Main Street. The truck was covered with Annie's magnets, and we tossed them into the crowd. We ran back and forth, handing out boxes of Annie's. Try it, we said, and if you like it, tell a friend. The Boom Box Parade has grown in popularity over the past two decades. And, so has Annie's. A constant for me are the connections I make with our consumers - they are as meaningful now as they were 25 years ago. Bye for now, Annie. For even more suggestions, visit us at Annies.com.

When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official rabbit of approval representing the simplicity, care, and goodness in all of our products. Dear Friend, My husband Rob and I were the Annie's consumer relations and mail order team for several years and were accustomed to the phone ringing day and night. If the phone rang at 2:00 AM, it might have been a friend or family member, but more likely it was someone calling to order mac & cheese. Annie's original warehouse was an old grain mill without climate control. Rob and I hand-addressed every mail-ordered case, and during the winter months I often used a hair dryer to keep my fingers nimble. We packed our two-door Volkswagen with up to 50 cases, keeping our tiny post office busy. My connection to our consumers deepened with every case sent during those years; a connection, I believe, is the foundation of Annie's. Bye for now, Annie.

Dear Friend, Soon after we met, my husband Rob and I started our small, organic vegetable farm in northeastern Connecticut. We planted half an acre of asparagus on former pasture land and slowly expanded every year. We use no chemical fertilizers, herbicides, or pesticides, instinctively knowing that the health of the soil and water is a priority. We compost, mulch, hoe, weed, and pick off foraging bugs. From the microorganisms in our soil, to the honey bees and butterflies pollinating, to the Purple Martins swooping for insects - all contribute to our organic practices. Working together, we are enhancing our tiny piece of Earth, and that's a beautiful thing. By for now, Annie. Support family farms - use organic milk, butter, and yogurt!

Dear Friend, My husband Rob and I were the Annie's Consumer Relations and Mail Order team for several years and were accustomed to the phone ringing day and night. If the phone ran at 2:00 am, it might have been a friend or family member, but more likely it was someone calling to order mac cheese. Annie's original warehouse was an old grain mill without climate control. Rob and I hand-addressed every mail-ordered case, and during the winter months I often used a hair dryer to keep my fingers nimble.

When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official rabbit of approval representing the simplicity, care, and goodness in all of our products. Dear Friend, My husband Rob and I were the Annie's Consumer Relations and Mail Order team for several years and were accustomed to the phone ringing day and night. If the phone rang at 2:00 AM, it might have been a friend or Tamil member, but more likely it was someone calling to order mac cheese. Annie's original warehouse was an old grain mill without climate control. Rob and I hand-addressed every mail-ordered case, and during the winter months I often used a hair dryer to keep my fingers nimble. We packed our two-door Volkswagen with up to 50 cases, keeping our tiny post office bust. My connection to our consumers deepened with every case sent during those years; a connection, I believe, is the foundation of Annie's. Bye for now. - Annie.

When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official rabbit of approval representing the simplicity, care, and goodness in all of our products. Dear Friend, My husband Rob and I were the Annie's Consumer Relations and Mail Order team for several years and were accustomed to the phone ringing day and night. If the phone rang at 2:00 AM, it might have been a friend or family member, but more likely it was someone calling to order mac & cheese. Annie's original warehouse was an old grain mill without climate control. Rob and I hand-addressed every mail-ordered case, and during the winter months I often used a hair dryer to keep my fingers nimble. We packed our two-door Volkswagen with up to 50 cases, keeping our tiny post office busy. My connection to our consumers deepened with every case sent during those years; a connection, I believe, is the foundation of Annie's. Bye for now, Annie.

Dear Friend, In our early years, we relied on creativity to get our mac & cheese into as many hands as possible. Opportunities came with events such as the Boom Box Parade in Willimantic, Connecticut. As a clever alternative to a marching band, everyone marched with their own boom box volume turned way up. We piled cases of Annie's into my husband's truck and joined the fire trucks, floats, and marchers parading down Main Street. The truck was covered with Annie's magnets, and we tossed them into the crowd. We ran back and forth, handing out boxes of Annie's. Try it, we said, and if you like it, tell a friend.

Annies Organic Macaroni & Cheese, Peace Pasta & Parmesan	6 oz (170 g)	Certified organic. Rabbit of approval. Made with goodness! No artificial flavors, synthetic colors or preservatives. A good source of calcium & protein. Our farms produced this without antibiotics, synthetic hormones or persistent pesticides. Made with 100% real cheese Organic Valley. Farmer-owned. USDA organic. Meet Bernie! Bernie was Annie's pet Dutch rabbit. When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official rabbit of approval representing the simplicity, care, and goodness in all of our products. Dear Friend, My husband Rob and I were the Annie's Consumer Relations and Mail Order team for several years and were accustomed to the phone ringing day and night. If the phone rang at 2:00 AM, it might have been a friend or family member, but more likely it was someone calling to order mac & cheese. Annie's original warehouse was an old grain mill without climate control. Rob and I hand-addressed every mail-ordered case, and during the winter months I often used a hair dryer to keep my fingers nimble. We packed our two-door Volkswagen with up to 50 cases, keeping our tiny post office busy. My connection to our consumers deepened with every case sent during those years; a connection, I believe, is the foundation of Annie's. Bye for now, - Annie. Support family farms - use organic milk, butter, and yogurt! For even more suggestions, visit us at www.Annies.com.
