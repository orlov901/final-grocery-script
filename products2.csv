Werthers Original Caramels, Soft	4.51 oz (128 g)	Soft and creamy caramels made with real butter and fresh cream. New! The old world recipe. 160 calories per serving. 6 pieces per serving. A long time ago, in the small European village of Werther, candy-maker Gustav Nebel created his finest candy. He used the best ingredients - real butter, fresh cream, white and brown sugars, a pinch of salt and a lot of time - to create a treasure worthy of being wrapped in gold.

By the end of the far his mother said, The only thing you haven't used them for is liquorice. Don't I feel silly, he said (wearing a suit of strawberries). Color and flavor derived from natural sources. This product left us in fresh & perfect condition. Should it not meet your expectations, please return it to your place of purchase. www.darrelllea.com.

Darrell Lea Liquorice, Soft Eating, Green Apple Flavor	7 oz (200 g)	Est. 1927. Natural flavor. 100% Australian owned. Preservative free. Low salt. Proudly Still in Australian Hands: Darrell Lea has been making Australia's finest chocolates, freshest liquorice and most delectable confectionary since 1927. Our most famous invention is soft-eating liquorice that we invented in a small factory under the iconic arches of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. We're immensely proud that we're still 100% Australian-owned and 100% Australian-loved. Loved by Aussie mums and dads and nanas and grandpas and lots of little kids all across the country. Lea Legends No. 9: Emergency Apple Landing: Sometimes attempting great feats makes you realise the best flavors of liquorice have been sorely neglected. Such as when Darrell Lea made an emergency landing in a field of apples after hang gliding over Bass Straight. Entranced by their flavor, he pondered aloud, is this heaven? No, answered the nearby farmer. This is destiny. Whether he was being philosophical; or if it was the name of his horse was not important; apple liquorice was born! Color and flavor derived from natural sources. This product left us in fresh & perfect condition. Should it not meet your expectations, please return it to your place of purchase. www.darrelllea.com.

Vermont Village Organic Applesauce, Unsweetened	24 oz (680 g)	USDA Organic. It's all about the apples. In 1977 we began gathering apples from abandoned homestead orchards here in Vermont - finding forgotten heirlooms in our neighboring hills and pastures. Since much of our fruit grew wild and untended it made sense to let its natural character and taste shine through. So we became the first company to sell additive-free, no-sugar-added, all-natural applesauce to supermarkets, and we were certified as an organic processor many years before most of our customers knew what organic meant. Today, our 100% pesticide-free organic applesauce is still made by cooking whole apples in small-batch kettles. Maybe it's because 9-12 apples go into each 24-ounce jar that here in Vermont people constantly tell us. It tastes just like my grandmother used to make! www.VermontVillageApplesauce.com.

Visit Our Home Farm: You already know Cascadian Farm is one of the country's leading organic brands. But Cascadian Farm is also a real place - a working, active, productive farm dedicated to growing the very best organic food & educating visitors about organic farming. Although we've grown beyond the borders of our home farm in Skagit Valley, WA, you can still visit us there where it all started in 1972. Plan a trip to stop by our farm stand for a pint of our fresh, seasonal berries or homemade organic ice cream. If your travels aren't taking you to Washington any time soon, you can still visit our home farm with an interactive, virtual tour at CascadianFarm.com/farmtour. Open May - October. Cascadian Home Farm, 55749 State Route 20, Rockport, WA 98283. Why We Go Organic: Why is organic so important to us? Simple. It's good for people and good for the environment. Organic farmers work with nature to build rich, healthy soil and preserve biodiversity and critical water resources. Organic farming also means crops are grown without the use of genetic engineering (GMOs) or synthetic pesticides and fertilizers. By eating organic, we not only limit our exposure to these synthetic chemicals but also respect and utilize nature's rich ecosystem. It's food just the way it should be. Helps us save the bees! Did you know - Bees are responsible for the pollination of over two-thirds of the world's agriculture crops? Unfortunately, bee populations are declining at an alarming rate due to habitat loss, disease, and pesticides. A world without pollinators would be a world without vital crops such as almonds, berries, and apples. What can you do to help? Plant native wildflowers in your yard. Choose organic.

We also care about how it's grown and the people who make it possible. So when we first visited the remote Altiplano region of Bolivia, we asked the quinoa farmers what we could do to help them continue their sustainable farming practices or support their families. They responded by expressing a need for lights in their homes - a small luxury we take for granted. The truth is, because they're in such a remote place, they had to rely on candles and kerosene, which made it difficult to do things like cook, study or even spend time with family when the sun went down. So with the help of our quinoa supplier, Andean Naturals, we've installed 60 solar panels to give them lights in their homes for the very first time and that makes us all feel really, really good.

When she started the company, Annie chose him to be our official rabbit of approval representing the simplicity, care, and goodness in all of our products. Dear friend, with two growing daughters, my husband Rob and I join all other parents in welcoming more snack choices. On our organic farm, we also strive for more choices by growing niche produce and new varieties of popular summer vegetables that we sell the local farmer's market. Our local market friends have learned to expect and enjoy the unexpected from us. Bye for now, Annie. A short course in the long history of chocolate. Cacao was highly prized by the Aztec civilization and in use for over 3000 years, and yet - milk chocolate was not invented until 1875! From the pod comes the bean, which is roasted to become the essence of chocolate - the nib. Theobroma cacao (the scientific name, theobroma, means food of the gods). That should tell you all you really need to know about chocolate. It's decidedly delectable! We work with trusted suppliers to source only non-GMO ingredients. Wait! Don't throw this box in the trash! It's really quite valuable. When you flatten it and put it in a curbside bin, you can take heart in knowing that it may have a future as an egg carton, as tissue, or more Annie's boxes. This box is made from recycled paper, with at least 35% post-consumer waste (PCW).

Kashi Chewy Bars, Chewy Nut Butter Bars, Salted Chocolate Chunk	5 - 1.23 oz (35 g) bars [6.15 oz (175 g)]	Made with almond butter. Non GMO Project verified. nongmoproject.org. Transitional certified by QAI. GF: gluten free. Fair Trade Certified ingredients. New! These bars are not organic. They're Certified Transitional, an initiative we helped create to support farmers transitioning their conventional farmland to organic. Why do they need support? Well, farmers have to go through a three-year transition period to be able to apply for USDA Organic certification. That's three years of implementing organic practices on their land without a return on their investment immediately, so they're less motivated to make the change. So to source the almond butter in these delicious bars, we called our friend Richard who lives just north of us in Turlock, California. Richard is a second-generation almond farmer who believes that having healthy soil is better for the earth today and in the future. And when you buy these bars, you're helping to support Richard and all the transitional farmers who are nurturing a better tomorrow by moving organic food forward one acre at a time.

So to source the almond butter in these delicious bars, we called our friend Richard - you're helping to support Richard and all the transitional farmers who ire nurturing a better tomorrow - who lives just north of us in Turlock, California. Richard is a second-generation almond fanner who believes that having healthy soil is better for the earth today and in the future. And when you buy these bars, you're helping to support Richard and all the transitional farmers who are nurturing a better tomorrow by moving organic food forward one acre at a time.

The Bob's Red Mill team went to Scotland to compete in the Olympics of oatmeal, the Annual Golden Spurtle World Porridge Making Championship.

The ultimate oatmeal throwdown. www.sparforthespurtle.com. Our product line is diverse and extensive. For information and recipes, visit our website at www.bobsredmill.com. Dear Friends, Steel Cut Oats have always been a universal customer favorite at Bob's Red Mill. Their robust oat flavor, texture and ease of preparation plus proven nutritious benefits and cholesterol reduction make them a perfect breakfast. A few years back we learned of the World Championship Porridge Competition in Scotland called the Golden Spurtle. At that point we had yet to discover the spurtle - a centuries-old Scottish wooden porridge stirring implement.

Dear friends, Whole grain foods are important to your diet. A whole grain includes all three parts of the grain kernel: the bran, endosperm and germ. In addition to fiber, they also contain important vitamins, minerals, and hundreds of unique phytochemicals. Recent scientific research has discovered that the benefits of eating whole grains come from the synergistic effects of the fiber, vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals - not just the individual components. Studies clearly show that including whole grains in your diet may reduce your risk of certain chronic diseases. Certain Cancers: Scientific evidence suggests that eating whole grains reduces the risks for some cancers, especially gastrointestinal cancers. Heart Disease: Antioxidants contained in whole grains may work with fiber and other compounds to reduce your overall risk of heart disease. So for your good health, start eating at least three servings of whole grain foods every day. My Bob's Red Mill 5 Grain Hot Cereal is a delicious way to include them in your diet.

Bobs Red Mill Wheat Germ, Natural Raw	12 oz (0.75 lb) 340 g	The heart of the wheat kernel. A natural source of folic acid. You can see our quality! Wheat Germ is the heart of the wheat berry. It has a delicious nutty flavor, and is packed with nutrition. For a scant 45 calories and one gram of unsaturated fat, a two tablespoon serving will provide two grams of dietary fiber, ten percent of recommended daily value of folic acid, eight percent of your thiamin requirements. It is a cholesterol and sodium free food, and its fat is unsaturated. You can use Wheat Germ to replace up to one half cup of flour when baking cookies, muffins and breads. Use it as a topping for fruit pies, fruit salads, yogurt and ice cream, or as a nutritious breading for chicken or fish and as filler for meatballs and meatloaf. All natural. To your good health - Bob Moore. Friend of the heart. An employee-owned company. Dear friends, we would love to share important information about wheat germ with you. A 2 tablespoon serving of wheat germ provides: Vitamin E - Best known for its positive association with heart disease prevention, vitamin E has also been linked with a host of other health benefits including strengthening the immune system. Ironically, some of the best sources of vitamin E are higher-fat foods. Since wheat germ contains only 1 gram of fat per serving, adding wheat germ as a source of vitamin E to your diet makes it easier to stay within the recommended fat guidelines. 2 tablespoons wheat germ = 15% of the recommended daily value;: Folic Acid - Also known as folate or folacin. This B vitamin is necessary for heart and blood-vessel health, and for proper cell replication. Research has linked it with helping to protect against neural tube birth defects. Current recommendations are that all women of childbearing age consume 400 micrograms of folic acid every day. 2 tablespoons wheat gem = 38 mcg folic acid = 10% of the recommended daily value: Other Essential Minerals - Provides 8% of the recommended daily value of phosphorus, magnesium and zinc; Dietary Fiber - Provides 8% of the recommended daily value. Did You Know? Bob's Red Mill also manufactures the largest selection of whole grain foods available anywhere. If you do not see these products in your store, ask for them. Diets rich in whole grain foods and other plant foods low in total fat, saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease and some cancers.
