Carrs Crackers, Table Water	4.25 oz (120 g)	Baked with toasted sesame seeds. City of Carlisle, Carr's Biscuit Manufacturers since 1831. Open sesame! Sesame is one of the world's oldest spices. In ancient times, sesame seeds were used to make wine by Assyrians, eaten plain as energy-giving combat rations by Greeks, and regarded as symbols of immortality by Hindus. Sesame seeds have a nutty flavor. This is enhanced by toasting, giving them a delicate, almond-like taste and aroma. Carr's Table Water Crackers with Toasted Sesame Seeds will add a touch of elegance whenever you entertain. The story of Carr's crackers began in 1831, when Jonathan Dodgson Carr established a small bakery in Carlisle, England. The business thrived, and in 1841 it was granted a Royal Warrant by Queen Victoria. The first Carr's Table Water crackers were created by Jonathan Carr for English sea farers on their long voyages. Carr's Table Water crackers are still baked today in the proud tradition established by Jonathan Carr, using soft Cumbrian water, local wheat flour, and traditional brick ovens.

Madhava Brownie Mix, Ooey-Gooey Chocolate	18 oz (510 g)	Made with ancient grains and organic sweeteners. Naturally sweet. Deliciously organic. USDA organic. No GMOs. The Sweet Life: Take one honey enthusiast; team him up with some local, hard-working honeybees and you've got a recipe for something harmonious. Although Madhava started with honey, it's more than 40 years later and mother nature is still lending us a hand in making the most delectable, organic and non-GMO products around. Since those early days our efforts have blossomed beyond honey. We've taken our love of all-natural sweeteners and created delicious new products using ingredients you'd find in your own kitchen. We know how important our sweeteners are to making the best tasting treats around. From breakfast to baked goods, croissants to coffee; we've got a purely scrumptious product to fit the bill. Because your sweet tooth deserves better than chemicals and artificial preservatives. Pure. Natural. Scrumptious. Sweet! All We Need is Love (and Brownies): Our love of brownies drove us to make a better batter, like brownies made from scratch (without all the work). We gathered up all the pure delicious ancient whole grains and natural sweeteners we could find. You won't find any overly-processed sugars, chemicals or preservatives here. Just the ooey-gooey, rich, chocolate stuff delicious brownies are made of. Sweeeeet! Madhava Sweetened: Sticking with what we know, we created our line of baking mixes using our very own Madhava Coconut Sugar. It's sustainably grown and harvested, as well as organic and non-GMO verified. Everything we do begins with our founding philosophy to use the best quality ingredients we can find. Ancient Grains: When you're making an organic baking mix that rivals homemade, only all-natural, minimally-processed ingredients will do. That's why we use delectable organic ancient grains to work alongside our own coconut sugar. Ancient Grains are rich in nutrients, less chewy than other whole grains & have less gluten than modern wheat flour. What's not to love? Paperboard Packaging: 100% recycled fibers. Sustainable Forestry Initiative: Certified sourcing. www.sfiprogram.org. Carton made with wind energy. Certified organic by: Colorado Dept. Of Agriculture. Vegan. We keep it clean. Nothing artificial here, including GMO's. We are committed to providing non-GMO products to our consumers. That's why our new Baking Mixes are not just organic, they are also non-GMO.

Publix Salt, Iodized	26 oz (1 lb 10 oz) 737 g	This salt supplies iodide, a necessary nutrient. Salt: The Flavor Maker: Of course, we all love salt sprinkled on our popcorn, or on hard-boiled eggs or French fries. But salt does so much more than simply lend a salty taste to food. It actually heightens, balances and improves other flavors. Have it Handy: Keep a wide-mouthed jar filled with salt in the kitchen. That way, when you're cooking, you can easily take a pinch or scoop up a measuring spoonful. Why Iodized Salt? Back in 1924, the Michigan State Medical Society launched a public-health program where iodine was added to table salt. The practice has continued ever since, helping to prevent the thyroid problems and mental deficiencies that can be caused by a lack of iodine. Try These Tips: A pinch of salt added to coffee grounds will enhance the flavor of brewed coffee. Coat rinsed potatoes with cooking spray and sprinkle with salt before baking. Prevent browning of peeled apples, potatoes or pears by rinsing in cold, lightly salted water. Salt combined with lemon juice will remove mildew and rust around the house. www.publix.com.

Morton Kosher Salt is a versatile salt loved by chefs for its texture, ease of use and its ability to bring out the natural flavors of food. The coarse flake crystals of Morton Kosher Salt are much bigger than regular table salt crystals, making Morton Kosher Salt easy to pinch for measuring and sprinkling. Also, the larger flakes adhere well to food and dissolve slowly, providing a well-rounded flavor. While Morton Kosher Salt can be used in many ways, it's ideal for brining, rimming margarita glasses as well as roasting, marinades and rubs. At Morton, we make sure only the best salt crystals reach your plate so every dish you create will be as flavorful as you intend when you use Morton Kosher Salt. To learn more about culinary salts and for recipes visit www.MortonSalt.com. Facebook: Find us at Facebook.com/MortonSalt. Brining Meat: Brining creates extra tender, juicy and flavorful meat. It does so by locking in meat's natural juices, which prevents meat from drying out while cooking. To brine, you simply soak the meat in a solution of salt and water prior to cooking.

Morton Salt, Kosher, Coarse	16 oz (1 lb) 453 g	This salt does not supply iodide, a necessary nutrient. Morton Kosher salt is a versatile salt loved by chefs for its texture, ease of use and its ability to bring out the natural flavors of food. The coarse flake crystals of Morton Kosher salt are much bigger than regular table salt crystals, making Morton Kosher salt easy to pinch for measuring and sprinkling. Also, the larger flakes adhere well to food and dissolve slowly, providing a well-rounded flavor. While Morton Kosher salt can be used in many ways, it's ideal for brining, rimming margarita glasses as well as roasting, marinades and rubs. At Morton, we make sure only the best salt crystals reach your plate so every dish you create will be as flavorful as you intend when you use Morton Kosher salt.

Sunbeam Hot Dog Buns	8 buns [12 oz (340 g)]	Enriched buns. Per 1 Bun: 120 calories; 0 g sat fat (0% DV); 220 mg sodium (9% DV); 4 g sugars. History of Sunbeam Bread: Probably no other bread brand in America has the personality and appeal of Little Miss Sunbeam. For more than 50 years, the image of this sweet girl has been synonymous with fresh, quality baked foods. In the early 1940's, Quality Bakers of America (QBA), a cooperative of independent bakers, commissioned artist Ellen Segner to create an image of a little girl for a trademark that could be used by its member bakeries. One day, while in New York's Washington Square Park, Ms. Segner saw a pretty, blonde-hair girl playing. She made a sketch of the girl and from this sketch created the image of Little Miss Sunbeam. No one knows the name of the little girl that first inspired Ms. Segner. Little Miss Sunbeam made her debut in the fall of 1942, appearing on packaging in the Philadelphia area. She was an overnight success. In 1944, Flowers Bakeries became the sixth bakery in the country to use the little Miss Sunbeam brand. During the 1950's QBA bakeries around the country held Little Miss Sunbeam look-alike contests. The girls who won these regional contests went on to compete at a national level. Today, Little Miss Sunbeam is one of the most well-recognized bread brands in the country. Flowers Bakeries is proud to bring you charming Little Miss Sunbeam and her delicious, wholesome Sunbeam products.

Sunbeam Hot Dog Buns	12 buns [18 oz (1 lb 2 oz) 510 g]	Enriched buns. Bread is a low fat, cholesterol free food. Per 1 Bun: 120 calories; 0 g sat fat (0% DV); 220 mg sodium (9% DV); 4 g sugars. History of Sunbeam Bread: Probably no other bread brand in America has the personality and appeal of Little Miss Sunbeam. For more than 50 years, the image of this sweet girl has been synonymous with fresh, quality baked foods. In the early 1940's, Quality Bakers of America (QBA), a cooperative of independent bakers, commissioned artist Ellen Segner to create an image of a little girl for a trademark that could be used by its member bakeries. One day, while in New York's Washington Square Park, Ms. Segner saw a pretty, blonde-haired girl playing. She made a sketch of the girl and from this sketch created the image of Little Miss Sunbeam. No one knows the name of the little girl that first inspired Ms. Segner. Little Miss Sunbeam made her debut in the fall of 1942, appearing on packaging in the Philadelphia area. She was an overnight success. In 1944, Flowers Bakeries became the sixth bakery in the country to use the Little Miss Sunbeam brand. During the 1950's, QBA bakeries around the country help Little Miss Sunbeam look-alike contests. The girls who won these regional contests went on to compete at a national level. Today, Little Miss Sunbeam is one of the most well-recognized bread breads in the country. Flowers Bakeries is proud to bring you charming Little Miss Sunbeam and her delicious, wholesome Sunbeam products. We are committed to providing you with quality products and welcome your questions and comments. Call 1-866-245-8921, Consumer Relations Department.

Healthy Life Bread, 100% Whole Wheat, Southern Country Style	12 oz (340 g)	Family bakers since 1925. 100% Whole grain. Low fat. Heart healthy. Good source of fiber. Whole grains for a healthy heart. Not all whole grain products are created equal. Healthy Life Southern Country Style 100% Whole Wheat Bread is qualified to make the FDA approved heart health claim: Diets rich in whole grain foods and other plant foods and low in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease and certain cancers. More than just bread - It's Healthy Life. 0 g Trans fats. No saturated fats. No hydrogenated oils. No artificial preservatives. No potassium bromate. No cholesterol. All whole grain. Whole Grains for a Healthy Heart: Whole grain foods reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer. The National Academy of Sciences reports that diets high in plant foods, such as fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grain foods are associated with a lower occurrence of coronary heart disease and cancers of the lung, colon, esophagus and stomach. Do you get enough whole grains? Most Americans don't. The new USDA Dietary Guidelines recommend eating 6 servings of grain-based foods per day with 3 of them being whole grains. Healthy Life Southern Country Style Breads can help fulfill that recommendation. A wheat kernel is made up of 3 parts - the largest part of the kernel called the endosperm, the hard outer covering which is the bran and the tiniest part of the kernel, the germ, which would grow new wheat if the kernel were planted. The endosperm is ground to make white flour, but when all parts of the kernel are ground together, the result is 100% whole wheat flour which is also whole grain flour. Healthy Life Southern Country Style Breads are made from 100% whole grain wheat flour. Many other popular-selling breads contain enriched white flour, enriched wheat flour or unbleached wheat flour which are not whole grains and not 100% whole wheat. Always check ingredient listings and look for the words whole or 100% whole before the name of the grain or flour. What's so good about whole grains? Whole grain foods give you: complex carbohydrates for a steady supply of fuel to provide sustained energy when engaging in physical activity (from the endosperm); vitamins and minerals, including trace minerals and antioxidants, many of which are in short supply in our modern diets (from the germ and bran); fiber, both soluble and insoluble, to aid in good digestive health, help regulate blood sugar and make us feel full and satisfied without adding any calories (from the bran); many other natural plant compounds called phytochemicals. Scientists believe phytochemicals in whole grains, together with the vitamins, minerals, and dietary fiber, may contribute to whole grains' health benefits. 100% Whole grain 24 g or more per serving. Eat 48 g or more of the whole grains daily.Show LessTrans fats. No saturated fats. No hydrogenated oils. No artificial preservatives. No potassium bromate. No cholesterol. All whole grain.

Sunbeam Bread, Enriched, Bar-B-Q	16 oz (1 lb) 454 g	Sliced. Per 1 Slice: 70 calories; 0 g sat fat (0% DV); 140 mg sodium (6% DV); 2 g sugars. Bread is a low fat, cholesterol free food. History of Sunbeam Bread: Probably no other bread brand in America has the personality and appeal of Little Miss Sunbeam. For more than 50 years, the image of this sweet girl has been synonymous with fresh, quality baked foods. In the early 1940's, Quality Bakers of America (QBA), a cooperative of independent bakers, commissioned artist Ellen Segner to create an image of a little girl for a trademark that could be used by its member bakeries. One day, while in New York's Washington Square Park, Ms. Segner saw a pretty, blonde-haired girl playing. She made a sketch of the girl and from this sketch created the image of Little Miss Sunbeam. No one knows the name of the little girl that first inspired Ms. Segner. Little Miss Sunbeam made her debut in the fall of 1942, appearing on packaging in the Philadelphia area. She was an overnight success. In 1944, Flower Bakeries became the sixth bakery in the country to use the Little Miss Sunbeam brand. During the 1950's, QBA bakeries around the country held Little Miss Sunbeam look-alike contests. The girls who won these regional contests went on to compete at a national level. Today, Little Miss Sunbeam is one of the most-well recognized bread brands in the country. Flowers Bakeries is proud to bring you charming Little Miss Sunbeam and her delicious, wholesome Sunbeam products.

Bunny Bread, 100% Whole Wheat, Original	16 oz (1 lb) 454 g	Family bakers since 1925. No trans fats. Low in fat. No saturated fat. No hydrogenated oils. No cholesterol. A good source of fiber. 100% Whole grain 24 g or more per serving. Eat 48 g or more of whole grains daily. No bromate. Bunny 100% whole wheat bread, is 100% whole grain bread! Two slices of Bunny 100% whole wheat bread provide 24 g or 50%, of the daily recommended amount of whole grains. It is recommended, by the USDA Dietary Guidelines, that we eat 6 servings each day of grain foods and at lest half of them should be whole grain. Bunny 100% whole wheat bread provides: complex carbohydrates for a steady supply of natural fuel for our bodies. They provide long-term energy for physical activities. Eating carbohydrates also produces serotonin, a chemical which affects the cells in our brain to help bring calmness and even moods; vitamins and minerals, including Vitamin E, B Vitamins, trace minerals, phytochemicals and antioxidants, substances many of us lack in our modern diets that are essential for good health; fiber, to aid in good digestion and make us feel full and satisfied without adding any calories. Foods that are high in fiber, such as whole grain breads, keep you full for a longer period of time. Therefore, Bunny 100% whole wheat bread, can help you lose weight or help you avoid snacking on foods with little nutrition. What is whole grain?

Several of the leading causes of illness in the United States have been linked to diet, namely heart disease, some cancers and diabetes. A well-balanced diet and increased physical activity can help offer some protection against these and other illnesses. Why eat whole grains? You can fulfill 29% of the daily-recommended intake of whole grains with one serving of Healthy Life Flaxseed Bread with Omega-3. Two slices contain 14 grams of whole grain. Containing antioxidants not found in other foods, whole grains pack a powerful punch against cancer-causing free radicals. Whole grains may lower triglycerides, improve insulin control, help with weight management and slow the buildup of arterial plaque. The vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and phytochemicals in whole grains all work together with the fiber content to help reduce the risk of some cancers and other chronic illnesses. Good source of omega-3 ALA from flaxseed. The essential fatty acids omega-3 and omega-6 must be obtained from food. Research indicates we consume too much omega-6 and not enough omega-3. When the balance is out of proportion, we are cut off from the protective benefits of Omega-3 and virtually every area of our body is susceptible to problems. The omega-3's we need can be found in marine sources (like salmon) and plant sources (like flaxseed). Eating Healthy Life Flaxseed Bread with Omega-3 can help you maintain more optimal health by providing a good source of omega-3. Contains 225 mg of omega-3 ALA per reference amount (50 g) which is 18% of the daily value of omega-3 ALA (1.3 g). Excellent source of fiber. The fiber in Healthy Life Flaxseed Bread with Omega-3 promotes good digestive health and can aid in weight loss efforts, fiber slows digestion and absorption so that glucose (sugar) in food enters the bloodstream slower, helping to even out blood sugar levels.

With just 40 calories per slice and no trans fat or saturated fat. Healthy Life Flaxseed Bread with Omega-3 is a smart choice. Eating more calories than you bum in a day forces your body to store the extra calories as body fat.

Roman Meal Sungrain Bread, 100% Whole Grain	16 oz (1 lb) 454 g	Good value for your family. Natural whole grain goodness. 24 whole grains per serving. Good source of fiber. Heart Healthy: Diets rich in whole grain foods and other plant foods and low in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol may help reduce the risk of heart disease and certain cancers. Roman Meal was born in 1912 when Dr. Robert Jackson reversed his failing health through diet and exercise. Dr. Jackson emulated the ancient Roman centurion's daily menu of whole wheat, whole rye, added bran and flaxseed. The Matthaei family, with bread-baking heritage dating back to the 1800's, purchased the formula in 1927 to include in their breads and cereals. With a strong commitment to health and whole grains, Roman Meal Company continues to make breads that are healthy and taste great. The words Roman Meal, Natural Whole Grain Goodness, and the Roman Meal Centurion logo are registered trademarks of the Roman Meal Company. Visit us at www.romanmeal.com. Whole wheat kernel. Wheat Bran: Protects seed. Fiber, B vitamins, trace minerals. Endosperm: Provides energy. Carbohydrates, protein, B vitamins. Wheat Germ: Provides nourishment. Phytonutrients, vitamin E, B vitamins, antioxidants. Did you know? Ordinary wheat flour comes from only the largest part of the wheat kernel. Roman Meal bread varieties include wheat bran and wheat germ too, so you get all the nutrients from the whole grain. Made with whole wheat tells you you're getting all components of the original wheat kernel. Roman meal bakes most of their bread varieties with whole wheat or whole grains as the first ingredient. The health benefits of whole grains come from the fiber, vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients and antioxidants which work together to reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Eating a variety of whole grains each day will help ensure that you get the nutrients needed to stay healthy. A good way to get whole wheat and whole grains in part of your daily diet is to enjoy them in a great tasting loaf of Roman Meal bread.

Sweet Leaf Iced Tea, Peach	16 fl oz (1 pt) 473 ml	Premium black tea blended with the rich flavor of peaches. All-natural. Peach flavor with other natural flavors. 160 calories per bottle. USDA organic. Est. 1998. Our Story: This flavor was inspired by the famous peaches of Fredericksburg, Texas. We think that a proper peach tea should be made with the best organic ingredients, should be tasty as all get-out, and remind you to relax a bit. So sit back, slow down, and enjoy the tea. When we first started, we brewed our tea in pillowcases and filled each bottle by hand. We've grown since then, but we're still inspired by Clayton's granny, Mimi, who taught us never to use ingredients we can't pronounce. We hope you have as much fun drinking our tea as we have making it. Enjoy, - Clayton & David. Please recycle. www.Sweetleaftea.com. Certified organic by International Certification Services, Inc.

Made with just a splash of 100% natural lime juice, straight or mixed, we think they're the most refreshing drinks since, well, since cranberry juice! Contains 28% juice.	http://www.publix.com/images/products/180000/183437-600x600-A.jpg	Nutrition Facts Serving Size 8 Fluid ounce(s) (240ml) Servings Per Container 8 Amount Per Serving Calories from Fat 0 Calories 110 % Daily Value* 0% Total Fat 0g 0% Saturated Fat 0g Trans Fat 0g 0% Cholesterol 0mg 2% Sodium 50mg 1% Potassium 55mg 9% Total Carbohydrates 28g 0% Dietary Fiber 0g Sugars 28g Protein 0g 0% Vitamin A 100% Vitamin C 0% Calcium 0% Iron * Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.

Smartwater Water, Vapor Distilled	50.7 fl oz (1 qt 18.7 fl oz) 1.5 lt	Vapor distilled water and electrolytes for taste. Spring water is for swimming. Smart water is for drinking. 0 calories per 12 fl oz serving. Let's drink responsibly and recycle. Green is totally sexy. Purity you can taste. Hydration you can feel. Is it just us or do clouds get a bad rap? While we admit they're not as great to have around on a beach day as say, the sun, clouds are unsung heroes because they contain nature's purest source of water. Meanwhile, spring water comes from the ground and contains random stuff and whatever else the animals that swim in it leave behind. That's why we copied our white puffy friends by creating Smartwater. It's vapor distilled so it is in its purest original state. But, we don't stop there. We one-up the clouds by adding electrolytes. It's a difference you can taste - unless; of course, you have no tastebuds (then you're on your own).

Le Bleu Water, Ultra Pure	50.7 fl oz (1.5 lt)	Distilled pure. Light & refreshing. The historical painting Blue Ridge Water Wagon symbolizes how once, finding pure, clean water was easy. When the air was clean, nature did a perfect job of making fresh, pure water. The sun evaporated water from lakes, streams, and oceans, then winds blew it to the mountains where it condensed into rain and snow. Now, we can duplicate this purity nature once so freely gave us. We go 5 steps beyond mother nature before the water ever enters the bottle. We steam distill our water, then perform additional purification through our patent pending purification process. Compare Le Bleu's taste and purity with any other bottled water and you make the choice. You'll like what we do to it!

Fiji Water, Natural Artesian	1.47 pt (700 ml)	From the islands of Fiji. Earth's finest water. In Fiji, tropical rain slowly filters through ancient volcanic rock before collecting in a sustainable aquifer deep within the earth. Along the way, the water gathers the vital minerals that give Fiji its signature soft smooth taste, and the naturally occurring electrolytes that are significantly higher than other brands. Bottled at the source, natural pressure forces Fiji towards a sealed delivery system and directly into the bottle. It's the way nature intended water to be. Untouched by man.

Fentimans Ginger Beer, Traditional	4 - 9.3 fl oz (275 ml) bottles	Est. 1905. Natural sodas. Fermented botanical ginger drink with herbal extracts. Botanically brewed. In the early 1900s, Fentimans began its seven-day brewing and fermentation process, creating its time-honoured recipe for success. Today, we continue this tradition by using only the finest ingredients, such as premium ginger root from the bazaars of Shanghai, with choice juniper and yarrow extracts from around the globe. After a fellow tradesman welshed on a loan, iron puddler Thomas Fentiman found himself in possession of a secret process for brewing a smashingly good Ginger Beer. His quintessentially British beverages quickly became one of Europe's most renowned effervescent refreshments. More than 100 years hence, Fentimans continues to tantalize persons of discerning taste across the continents. Established 1905.
