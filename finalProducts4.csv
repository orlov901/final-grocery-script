We hand select only the highest quality baby back pork ribs, choosing meaty, tender ribs that provide great texture and flavor.

Finally, when the time is right, we slather each rack with our sweet and tangy sauce to create the perfect balance of flavor. Big Shoulders Smokehouse delivers the quality and taste that rivals your favorite restaurant, yet they're fast and easy to prepare at home.
